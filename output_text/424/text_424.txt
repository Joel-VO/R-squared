Cri. M. C. No. 4693 of 2016

Dated this the 3” day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C.No.1151/2010
of Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara arising from Crime
No.219/2009 of Parassala Police Station for offences punishable
under Sections 354, 511 of 366 and read with Section 34 of IPC.

2. The allegation of the prosecution was that, the defacto
complainant had complained to the teacher against the
misconduct of the petitioner herein. As a retaliation, two weeks
thereafter, on 29.04.2009 at 8.10 a.m., while the defacto
complainant was proceeding from the College to the house, the
petitioner herein came in a car, driven by the 2" accused,
stopped near her and the 1 accused caught hold of her and tried
to pull her inside the car. This attracted others and the accused
withdrew from the scene.

3. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was
registered. After investigation, final report was laid against both
the accused. The 2" accused is absconding and is not available.

4, CrlM.C. is laid contending that the petitioner has

compromised the dispute with the 1* respondent, the defacto

(Cri. M, C. No, 4693 of 2016

complainant. It is stated that, the incident happened while both
were studying in the College and they were around 18 years at
that time. It was further submitted that, the parties have now
settled in their life and after considerable thought, the defacto
complainant had decided not to pursue with the case. An affidavit
have been filed by the 1* respondent dated 20.07.2016. Learned
counsel appearing for the 2" respondent submitted that, she has
been instructed to submit that the parties have resolved their
disputes. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that though
the allegation is serious, the petitioner herein is not involved in
any other crime.

5. Having regard to these facts, | feel that, at this length
of time, one more opportunity can be granted to the petitioner to
improve his way of life. Hence, | am inclined to quash the
criminal proceedings.

In the result, Crl.M.C, is allowed and all further proceedings
in $.C.No.1151/2010 of Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara
stand quashed.
