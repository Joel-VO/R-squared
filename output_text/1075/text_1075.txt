 506
8, Point Nos. 1 to 5 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point numbers 1 to 5

are considered together. Prosecution case is that accused has committed
offences punishable under sections 452, 294(b), 323, 324 and S06(i) of Indian
Penal Code, 1860. PW1, Sanoj deposed that the accused has not assaulted him

and he has no grievance against the accused. He admitted Ext. P1 statement.

9. PW2, Sanal denied the statement before the police. He further deposed that he

is not assaulted by the accused.

10. PW3, Santhosh Kumar denied the statement before the police.

11, The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and he is
justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of

prosecution. Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view

that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused. For the said reason

these points are found against the prosecution.

12. Point No. 6 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 to 5, the accused is found not
guilty of offences punishable under sections 452, 294(b), 323, 324 and S06(ii)
of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and he is acquitted for the said offences under
section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. His bail bond stand

cancelled and he is set at liberty.
