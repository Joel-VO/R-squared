THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 crt..c. 5599/2020 2020KERAI6

ORDER
Dated this the 6th day of January 2021

Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

2. The petitioners are the accused in Crime No.
744 of 2020 of Aluva Edathala Police Station registered
for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323 read
with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

It is submitted by the learned counsel for

the petitioners that the parties have resolved their entire
disputes among themselves and as such there is no
subsisting dispute between them. Therefore, this petition
to quash the Annexure Al FIR in Crime No.744 of 2020 of
Aluva Edathala Police Station.

4, Learned counsel appearing for the 1”
respondent/defacto complainant has submitted that she has
absolutely no grievance or complaints against the
petitioners. Annexure A2 is the affidavit sworn to by her
in support of the submission of the petitioners. The
affidavit further indicates that she has no intention to

pursue the matter further.
 crt..c. 5599/2020 2020KERAI6

5. The learned Public Prosecutor has reported that
the prosecution has no serious objection in allowing the
petition. It is also submitted that as the dispute has
been amicably settled, the possibility of conviction is
remote and bleak and therefore, no useful purpose would
be served in proceeding with the case.

- On hearing the submissions of all concerned,
on perusal of the records as well on consideration of the
special facts and circumstances involved in this case, I
find that no fruitful purpose is likely to be served by
proceeding with the matter against the petitioners.
Moreover, no public interest is involved in the case and
there is no legal impediment in granting the prayer as
sought for by the petitioners. Therefore, for the purpose
of securing the ends of justice, this Crl.M.c. is only to
be allowed.

For the foregoing reasons, Annexure Al FIR in
Crime No.744 of 2020 of Aluva Edathala Police Station and
all further proceedings therein will stand quashed as
prayed for.
