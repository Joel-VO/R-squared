Mc.

Dated this the 8" day of January , 2024

This Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is
filed by the first accused in C.C.No.1404 of 2016, on the
file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,
Thiruvananthapuram, to direct the Magistrate to recall the
arrest warrant pending against him and to release the
petitioner on bail, in the event of his appearance/surrender
before that court.

2. The petitioner herein is alleged to have
committed offences punishable under Sections 354, 451,
323 and 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of IPC. He got anticipatory
bail from this Court as early as on 23.06.2016. But it
seems that, he did not appear before the Investigating
Officer, to execute the bond as directed by this Court, in
the order dated 23.06.2016. Now he is intending to
surrender before the learned Magistrate and his request is

to direct the Magistrate to recall the warrant and to release
 224KERIIS7S
crl.M.c. We

him on bail when he surrenders before that court.

3. The case is of the year 2016. The petitioner,
after getting anticipatory bail, did not even care to execute
the bond, as directed by this Court. His case is that he did
not get summons from the court and so he failed to

appear before the learned Magistrate. Now this Court is

not in a position to verify the genuineness of his
contentions. So, the petitioner can appear/surrender in
C.C.No.1404 of 2016 pending before Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram. In case, he
makes a application for bail, learned Magistrate has to
consider and pass appropriate orders in that petition, on
the date of appearance/surrender itself, as far as, possible.

With these directions, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
