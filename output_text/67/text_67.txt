ORDER

The accused came up to quash the criminal

proceedings against her in three cases. It is in

connection with the malpractice and

mop

misappropriation done during the course of pledging
of gold ornaments with a private bank. Final
report was submitted. The accused No.6 was
employed as cashier in the said firm. The first
statement given by the defacto complainant and the
additional statement excludes her alleged role in
the crime. Hence, if it is proceeded further, it
will not serve any purpose. The crime and its
further proceedings including the final report as
against accused No.6 are hereby quashed. Crl.M.Cs

are allowed accordingly.
