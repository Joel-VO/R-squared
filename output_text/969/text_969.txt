‘of the motor cycle bearing Registration No. KL 20F 2761, without having valid
insurance, drove it via Kowdiar to Paipinmood road, rashly, negligently, and in a
‘manner so as to endanger human life and at high speed about 8:30 PM on

driven by the since deceased, near the Golf Links Road. Due to its impact, the since
deceased sustained grievous injuries and was taken to Medical College Hospital,
‘Thiruvananthepuram. Thereafter, on 23.03.2016, the since Deceased succumbed

‘committed the above stated offences.

3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279 and
304 A of the IPC, and Section 146 r/w 196 of the MV Act. On issuance of process,
the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by
‘a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were
furnished to him. The particulars of the aforesaid offences were read over and
‘explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs2, 7, 10 and 1 were examined as PWs 1 to
4 respectively and Exhibit P1 and P2 wore marked. The presence of CW8 and 9
could not be procured by the Prosecution and report filed to the effect that their
presence cannot be procured in the near future. Death Certificate of CW18 was
produced. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the
‘material witness turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no incriminating
circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the examination of the
Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No Defence
evidence was adduced,

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points
arise for consideration.

a, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a
‘manner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby
‘committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b, Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in rash or
negligent manner hit the vehicle of since deceased and caused him to
succumb to his injuries, and thereby committed the offence punishable w/S.

304 A of the IPC as alleged?

¢. Has the Accused driven the vehicle without having a valid insurance
and thereby commit offence punishable under section 146(1) r/w 196 of MV
Actas alleged?

d. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?
 4

6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and to avoid repetition.

PWI deposed that the deceased is the son of her friend and that she had
attested as witness to the Inquest proceedings and identified her sign in Exhibit PI
Inquest Report. PW2 and PW3 denied having witnessed the incident, having given
statement to that effect to the police and turned hostile to the Prosecution case.
PW4 deposed that the deceased is his nephew. ‘The accident took place on
16.03.201 near Golf Links Club at 8.25 pm. He deposed that he was informed of
the same by the Police through phone and when he reached Medical College
Hospital, he found the Accused to be sustained with grevious injuries on face.
Further he deposed that he gave Exhibit P2 statement to the police.

‘On going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW4 does
not have any direct knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the
witnesses who claimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of
the Prosecution. ‘The presence of other occurrence witnesses could not be
procured by the Prosecution. The deposition of PW4 cannot be admitted in
evidence as the same is only hearsay. The remaining witnesses were given up by
the Prosecution as no purpose would be served by examining them in the said
circumstances. Except for the mere allegation in the Charge that there was no
valid insurance policy on the motor cycle, no evidence brought forth to prove the
same. Nor any person acquainted with the handwriting and sign of Investigating
Officer examined. There is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the
‘witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident. The Prosecution
has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed
to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c)
are found in favour of the Accused.

7. Roint.d: In light of the finding on the above points, the question of awarding
sentence to the Accused does not arise.
 5

8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offences punishable under Sections 279, 304 A of the IPC and 146 rw 196 of MV
Act, Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of
CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
