 CrL.MC.No.8218 OF 2019(F) 2 aonommeRse

ORDER
Dated this the 6th day of January 2020

Petitioner is the 1° accused in Crime No.517/2014 of
Kuttiady Police Station presently pending before the 1*
Additional District and Sessions Court, Kozhikode as LP
No.22/2017 for having allegedly committed offences
punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 and
308 r/w Section 149 of IPC.

2. The only de facto complainant is the 3% respondent,
who has appeared through counsel and filed affidavit to the
effect that the matter has been amicably settled with the
petitioner and he does not have any grievance whatsoever
against the petitioner. A report has been filed by the
investigating officer to the effect that the petitioner has eight
other crimes registered against him, which also includes
offences punishable under Sections 308 and 324 of IPC. Going
by the description of the offence in the final report, it is seen
that the injury allegedly sustained by the de facto complainant
is not life threatening and it does not attract the offence under

Section 308 in the strict sense.
 CrL.MC.No.8218 OF 2019(F) 3 aonommeRse

3. In view of the fact that the 3% respondent has settled
the matter as against the 1* accused, no purpose will be
served by proceeding with the trial as against him. The fact
that the petitioner has criminal antecedents alone will not
stand in the way to quash the proceedings against the
petitioner. There is no public interest involved.

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed and the entire

proceedings as against the petitioner in Crime No.517/2014 of

Kuttiady Police Station presently pending against the petitioner
as L.P. No.22/2017 on the files of the 1* Additional District and
Sessions Court, Kozhikode stands quashed under Section 482

of CrP.C. and the accused is discharged.
