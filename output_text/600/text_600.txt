ORDER

The petitioners herein are the two accused in S.C. No.
394/2014 of the Court of Sessions, Ernakulam, now pending
before the learned Principal Assistant Sessions Judge,
Ernakulam. The incident of assault alleged in this case
happened in connection with some dispute regarding the
running time of two private buses. The Ernakulam Town North
Police Registered the Crime under Sections 341 & 308 read
with Section 34 of IPC on the complaint of one Shemim who

sustained ii

\juries in the alleged incident. He is the second
respondent herein. The petitioners now seek orders quashing
the prosecution on the ground that they and the said Shemim
have come to terms amicably out of Court, and the whole
dispute, which led to the unfortunate incident stands, resolved
for ever. The de facto complainant Shemim has filed affidavit

to the effect that the whole dispute stands resolved and he has

CFLM.C. No.7276 of 2018 2

No complaint or grievance. On a perusal of the prosecution
records including the wound certificate, I find that there is
absolutely nothing to attract Section 308 of IPC and that the
said section was incorporated on the basis of a purely
hypothetical statement. Anyway, the parties have come to
terms amicably and the de facto complainant has no grievance

‘or complaint now.

prosecution will not serve any purpose other than wasting the
precise time of the trial court, because there is no material to
‘support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial.

In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioners in S.C. No.394/2014 of the Court of
Sessions , Ernakulam, will stand quashed under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners
will stand released from the prosecution and the bail bond , if
any, executed by them will stand discharged.
