SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 8526 of 2017

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioner stands arrayed as the 2™ accused in S.C.
No.529/2017 of Additional District Court 1, Thalassery arising
from Crime No.1760/2016 of Mattannore Police Station for
offences punishable under Sections 7 read with Section 8 of the
POCSO Act. According to the petitioner, pursuant to the final
report filed, cognizance was taken and summons was issued to
him. Since he was away in connection with his employment, he
could not appear before the court below.

2. The petitioner submits that he is ready and willing to
appear before the court below, submit himself to the jurisdiction
and to participate in all future proceedings personally or through
his counsel. However, his apprehension is that since warrant has
been issued, the court below is not likely to take up the
applications to recall warrant and for bail on the same day of his
appearance and he is likely to be remanded.

3. Having considered the limited prayer sought by the
petitioner herein, notwithstanding the fact that he is involved in

two other cases of similar nature, still, to meet the ends of justice
 2018KERT23
Crl.M. C. No, 8526 of 2017 2
and to facilitate an early conclusion of the trial, | am inclined to
permit the petitioner to surrender before the court below within
10 days from today. If he surrenders within 10 days from today
and files applications for bail and to recall warrant, the same shall
be considered by the court below on the same day itself. The
warrant, if any issued from the court below will be kept in
abeyance till his actual date of appearance within the above 10
days.

Crl.M.C. is disposed of accordingly.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
