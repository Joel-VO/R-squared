 ORDER
Dated this the 7th day of January 2021

Petitioner claims to be the owner of a
Tipper Lorry bearing Registration No.KL-30-
A-3203. The vehicle was seized by the
Sub-Inspector of Police, ——Parippally,
alleging violation of the provisions of the
Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015
and the Mines and Minerals (Development and
Regulation) Act, 1957. After seizure, the
petitioner's vehicle was produced before the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court
(Temporary), South Paravur. On the basis of
an application submitted by the petitioner
under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the learned Magistrate issued
Annexure Al order directing release of the

vehicle, subject to conditions. The

2020/KERO27
 (cAL.M.C.NO.95 OF 2022, 2020KERII

a

petitioner complied with the conditions and
the vehicle was released.

2. This Crl.M.c is filed aggrieved by
condition No.4(G), in Annexure Al order,
directing the original documents produced
before the court to be retained in court
custody and to issue true certified copies
of those documents to the petitioner.
Annexure A2 is a similar order passed by
this Court whereby, conditions akin to
condition No.4(G), in Annexure Al were
modified.

3. On the facts of this case and in
view of the earlier order passed by this
Court under similar circumstances, I am
inclined to grant the relief sought.

In the result, condition No.4(G), in
Annexure Al is modified as follows:-

The petitioner shall submit an affidavit

undertaking to produce the original
 (cAL.M.C.NO.95 OF 2021 2020/KERO27

documents of the vehicle bearing
registration No.KL-30-A-3203 as and when
required by the court. On submission of such
affidavit, the original documents of the
vehicle kept in the safe custody of the
court shall be released to the petitioner,
after substituting those documents with
certified copies.

The Cri.M.C is allowed as above.
