Crl.M.C. No.3725 of 2013
Dated this the 4" day of January, 2021
ORDER

Considering the fact that the Crl.M.C is of the year 2013, pertaining to
Calender case of the year 2006, a report was called for from the
jurisdictional Magistrate Court. As per the report, out of the 7 accused
persons, Al and A2 are facing trial now. A3 is no more and A4 to A7 are
‘absconding, It is reported that prosecution has cited 8 witnesses, of whom
Cws 1 to 7 were examined as PW1 to PW7. The only remaining witness,
that is CW8, is a police officer who has failed to appear, in spite of summons
being repeated and even after issuance of non bailable warrant. This court is
‘often coming across instances where trial of criminal cases are being
delayed endlessly due to the deliberate absence of Investigating Officers.
This is an issue which should engage the attention of the Director General of
Prosecution. Such officers are ridiculing the justice delivery system and
should therefore be brought to book.

In view of the fact that only one more witness is to be examined, the
Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kannur is directed to take earnest efforts
to dispose C.C.No.366 of 2006 within an outer limit of three months from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
