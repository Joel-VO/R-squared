Crl.M.C No.83 of 2014

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2015

ORDER

The order of the court below declining release of the
petitioner's passport is under challenge. On 3.1.2014 this Court
directed the court below to release the passport on appropriate
conditions. In such a situation, I do not find the necessity of any
further hearing or probe. This order is made absolute and the
petitioner is allowed to possess his passport subject to the
conditions imposed by the court below. This Criminal

Miscellaneous Case is accordingly closed.
