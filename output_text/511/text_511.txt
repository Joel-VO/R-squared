PA TO JUDGE

2018KERADS
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 5” day of January, 2018

Petitioners are A2 to A4 in CC No.137/2012 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Adoor, based on
Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.743/2011 of Adoor
Police Station, for the offences punishable under Sections
294(b) and 324 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. On going through the contents of the final report,
it is evident that the offence under Section 294(b) IPC
cannot be attracted. The abusive words allegedly made use
of by the petitioners have not been mentioned anywhere in
the final report. Therefore, the offence under Section 294(b)
IPC is liable to be quashed.

3. Regarding the offence under Section 324 IPC,
there is an allegation that injuries were inflicted by beating

with a firewood and also by pelting stone. According to the
 201
(CALM.C.5783/2016

learned counsel for the petitioners, Annexures-A1 and A2
are mere counter cases to the cases registered against the
de facto complainant and his associates. Those matters
cannot be considered at present.

With liberty to the petitioners to take up all these
contentions before the trial court at appropriate stage, this
Crl.M.C. is disposed of, by making it clear that the offence
under Section 294(b) IPC has been quashed. As far as
practicable, the court below shall grant exemption to the
petitioners from personal appearance.
