Dated this the 6” day of December, 2017
ORDER

Annexure A6 order passed under Section 319 Cr.RC
by the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kanjirappally
for arraigning the petitioner as the 4” accused in
C.C.No.221/2013 is under challenge. Originally, the
Petitioner was arraigned as the 4” accused in the FIR. After
investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed as against
‘AJ to A3 alone by deleting A4 from the array of accused.

2. The prosecution examined PWs.1 and 2 in chief
before the court below. It seems that the chief-examination
itself is not complete. Material objects were not produced
and therefore, the material objects were to be identified, for

which the chief-examination has to continue.
 CRLM.C.No. $370 of 2016

3. PW1, who is the defacto complainant, filed
Annexure AS petition before the court below under Section
319 CrRC. for arraigning the petitioner also as the 4”
accused in the case. The court below passed Annexure A6
order in the following lines:

“Heard the petitioner's counsel. On a

perusal of the deposition of PW1 and
PW2 in their chief examinations it is clear
that the complicity of 4” accused in FIR,
that is Harris is established in the
commission of the alleged offences.
Hence the petition is allowed.”

4. According to the leamed counsel for the
petitioner, the court below has committed a grave error in
not passing a speaking order. The circumstances in which
the application of Section 319 CrRC. has become
necessitated, have not been shown in Annexure 6. The
learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned

counsel for the 2 respondent have relied on the decision of
 CRLM.C.No. $370 of 2016

the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Hardeep Singh
and others v. State of Punjab[2014(1) KHC 170] wherein
specific parameters have been prescribed for enabling the
application of Section 319 CrPC.

5. According to the petitioner, the details of the
petitioner who has to be impleaded as the 4” accused have
not been furnished. Apart from stating that ‘Harris of
Kanjirappally’, details of the petitioner and his address have
not been furnished anywhere in the chief-examination of
PWs.1 and 2 or Annexure 5. In Annexure AS what has been
stated is that the 4" accused in the FIR has to be arraigned
as the 4” accused in the case. On a perusal of Annexure A1
FIR in page No.2 of the paper book, it seems that the 4”
accused, who was arraigned in the FIR, was ‘Harris relative
of Shameer’. Without furnishing the details of the persons
to be arraigned as accused, the court below ought not to
have passed an order arraigning the petitioner as the 4"

accused. Apart from that, the court below ought to have
 CRLM.C.No. $370 of 2016

shown cogent reasons for arraigning the petitioner as the 4"
accused under Section 319 CrPC. It is not discemible from
Annexure A6 as to how the learned Magistrate could invoke
Section 319 CrPC.

In the result, this Cr.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A6
order is hereby quashed. Annexure AS is remitted to the
court below for fresh disposal in accordance with law. The
court below shall scrupulously follow the decision in

Hardeep Singh(supra) for disposing of Annexure AS.
