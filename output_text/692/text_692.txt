Cri. M. C. No. 8482 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C. No.1228/2017 of
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thaliparamba arising from
Crime No.367/2017 of Sreekandapuram Police Station, Kannur for
offence punishable under Section 498(A) of IPC. The allegation of
the prosecution is that after the marriage of the petitioner with
the 2" respondent held on 30.05.2009, the 2 respondent was
subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the petitioner in connection
with demand for dowry. Hence, she laid a complaint and crime
was registered. After investigation final report was filed,
Cognizance was taken and the matter is now pending before the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thaliparamba.

2. In the meanwhile, the petitioner has approached this
Court with a prayer that in the light of the settlement arrived at
between the parties, the parties are not interested in prosecuting
the matter and the proceedings may be quashed. To substantiate
the contention of the petitioner herein, he relied on Annexure A3
affidavit sworn to by the 2 respondent. Learned counsel for the

2% respondent relied on the averments contained in the petition
 2018KERASS
Crl.M, C. No, 8482 of 2017

as well as in the affidavit and submitted that the matter has been
settled. He also acknowledged the due execution of Annexure A3
affidavit.

3. The leamed Public Prosecutor on instructions
submitted that the parties have resolved their disputes and that
they are living together. The petitioner is not seen involved in
any other crime.

4, Having considered the fact that the dispute essentially
arose from a matrimonial discord, | feel that continuation of
further proceedings can only result in manifest injustice. Hence, |
am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to
quash the entire proceedings.

Accordingly, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in
C.C. No.1228/2017 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Thaliparamba stand quashed.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
