THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5699 OF 2020 2020/KERIIS72

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in
Crime No.556/2020 registered at the
Coyalmannam Police Station, Palakkad for
offence punishable under Section 435 of IPC.
The de facto complainant, at whose instance
the crime was registered, is arrayed as the
24 respondent. Annexure-B affidavit has
been filed by 2™ respondent stating that the
dispute, which was the reason for the
incident and registration of the crime, has
been resolved amicably and he has no
subsisting grievance against the
petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor
also, who, on instructions, submits that the

petitioners have no criminal antecedents.
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5699 OF 2020 2020/KERIIS72

3. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the damage
caused and having perused the affidavits
filed by the 2" respondent, the contents of
which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute
is settled and no public interest is
involved in this matter. Moreover, in view
of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is
remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State
of Punjab ((2008) 4 SCC 582) and Gian Singh
v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10
SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting

the relief sought.
 cont. M.c.No.5699 OF 2020 22UKERII?2

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed.
Annexure A FIR and the proceedings in Crime
No.556/2019 of Coyalmannam Police Station is

quashed.
