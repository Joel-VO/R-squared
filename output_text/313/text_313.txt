CrLM.C. No.2496 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER
The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.14 of 2004
registered by the Excise Range Office, Kodungalloor under
Sections 59(a) and 58 (g) of the Abkari Act. It is submitted
that the court below has already granted bail to the petitioner.

But, unfortunately thereafter, the petitioner went abroad

seeking employment and now he is employed outside the State
of Kerala. On account of the above reason, he was unable to

attend the court, when the matter was taken up for

consideration. In the absence of the petitioner, the case was
split up and renumbered as C.P.No.33 of 2007 on the files of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kodungalloor, which
was latter forwarded to the First Additional Sessions Court,
Thrissur and later, the same was registered as S.C.No.204 of
2008 which is pending before the First Additional Sessions

Court.

2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
now he is ready to surrender before the court below and to
seek regular bail. Apprehension of the petitioner is that as per
the practice followed by the learned Magistrate, if he
surrenders before the court below, he will be remanded to the
Judicial Custody, pending consideration of the bail application.
The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a direction to
the court below for considering the bail application on the date
of appearance.

3. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also.

I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand

the accused mechanically without application of mind.

However, to secure the interest of justice, the court below is
directed to consider the application for bail on the date of

appearance itself.
