THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 caMeeasere 3 20191KER/I2S1

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No. 1243 of
2018 of the Pulikeezhu Police Station registered for offences
punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147, 149, 294(B), 506, 427, 323,
324 and 307 of the IPC.

2, According to the prosecution, the petitioners herein formed
an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of their common object,
trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant on 5.11.2018 at
about 5.30 p.m. and attacked her husband and other family members
with weapons. It is also alleged that mischief was committed by the

accused causing a loss to the tune of Rs.1,79,000/-.

3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
submit that the petitioner as well as the de facto complainant and
others are near relatives. Only minor injuries were sustained by the
victims. Without taking note of the nature of injuries, the
investigating officer has incorporated Section 307 of the IPC. It is
further contended that parties were litigating in the civil court in
respect of a pathway leading to the property of the petitioners.

According to the learned counsel, in the course of proceedings, the
 caMeeasere 4 20191KER/I2S1

entire disputes have been settled and the parties are now living in
peace and harmony. The de facto complainant and the other injured
have filed separate affidavits before this court asserting that they
have no subsisting grievance and they have no objection in

terminating the criminal proceedings.

4, The learned counsel appearing for the party respondents
would contend that the crime was registered due to the
circumstances prevailing then, It is submitted that the entire
disputes have been settled and the party respondents have no further

grievance.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statements of the victims have been recorded and they have

stated in unmistakable terms that they have no further grievance.

6. [have considered the submissions advanced and have gone
through the statement of the witnesses and also the wound
certificate. Except for one Mary Kutty Kurian, the other witnesses
have sustained only contusions. Mary Kutty Kurian has suffered a

lacerated wound in the occipital region of the scalp, which injury
 caMeeasere 5 20191KER/I2S1

cannot be said to be serious.

7. In Gian Singh y, State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the
Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court
can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the

victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.

8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to
be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.
‘Though Section 307 has also been incorporated, the injury sustained
cannot in any way be regarded as serious. The parties are members
of the same family and they have managed to iron out their entire
disputes and to live in peace and harmony. It also does not appear
that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society.
It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise
would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even
otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a
waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having
considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered

view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary
 caMeeasere 6 20191KER/I2S1

powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A1 FIR
in Crime No. 1243 of 2018 of the Pulikeezhu Police Station and all

proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
