4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 20 were examined as PWs1

(b) of the CrPC. He denied all the incriminating evidence against him and claimed

6

Points (a) to (d): These points are considered together for the sake of

brevity and to avoid repetition.
 4of7
PW deposed that the since deceased is his nephew and that PW2, his son.
He deposed that he was informed of the incident over phone. He gave Exhibit Pl

statement to the police.

PW2 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident and that since
deceased is his cousin, who had driven the motor cycle, According to him the
incident occurred in Thumba due to the negligence of the lorry, but denied his
having given statement to the police as regards the driver and number of the lorry.

PW3, deposed to have witnessed the inquest proceedings of since deceased
‘and having attested Exhibit P2 Inquest Report. PW4, also deposed to that effect

‘and subsequently denied his signature.

PWS, is the Investigating Officer. He deposed that he registered Exhibit P3
FIR on the basis of the Exhibit P1 Statement, prepared Exhibit P2 Inquest Report,
Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar, Exhibit PS Seizure Mahazar to the effect of seizure of
the alleged offending vehicle. Further he deposed to have prepared Exhibit P6
Report reflecting the name and address of the Accused, whose arrest was recorded
‘and who was enlarged on bail. Exhibit P7 report reflecting addition of offence
punishable under Section 338 of the IPC was also prepared by him. He also
deposed that the vehicles involved were inspected by the AMVIs and Exhibits P8
and P9 are reports to that effect, and the Exhibit P10 is the scene plan prepared by
the Village Officer. Further, he also identified the Postmortem Certificate marked
as Exhibit P11 (subject to proof) sent ever to him and produce before the Court
PW4, during the cross-examination admitted that the vehicle driven by the since

deceased did not have a valid license as on the date of the incident.

‘The Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that the Prosecution could not
‘substantiate its case that it was on account of the alleged negligence or rashness

of the Accused that the alleged incident occurred. The fact that since deceased did
 5of7
not have a valid license as on the alleged date of incident has also to be taken into
consideration. PW2, the other injured, though deposed that the accident occurred
‘on account of the negligence of the lorry, he has neither identified the alleged lorry
nor the Accused as its driver. The Learned APP points out that the offending
vehicle has been seized and report also filed and further that merely because PWS
deposed that since deceased did not have valid license, that the accident occurred

due to the negligence of the since deceased.

This Court has carefully considered the materials placed on records and the
submissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused. As
rightly pointed out by the Accused, there are no independent evidence to prove the
complicity of the Accused in the alleged incident. The injured witness turned
himself against the case of Prosecution. Though he deposed to the effect that
Incident occurred due to the negligence of the lorry, he denied direct knowledge to
the same and denied to have identified the Accused and the vehicle. It is true that
merely because PWS deposed that since deceased did not have valid license, it
cannot be said that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the since
deceased. However, it is to be noted that the Prosecution has failed to discharge
its initial burden to prove the negligence, rashness on the part of the Accused,
‘especially on account of the testimonies of the witnesses and absence of proof of
medical evidence. There is nothing on record so as to implicate the Accused to the
alleged incident. Hence, this Court finds that the Prosecution failed to substantiate
its case beyond reasonable doubt. These points are therefore answered in favour of

the Accused.

7. Rolnt (e): In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are
found against the Prosecution, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise

8. 1m the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the
 Gof?
Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of the CrPC. His bail
bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
