PW2 denied having witnessed the incident and turned hostile to the
Prosecution case. PW3 deposed that he is an Ambulance driver. He also denied
having witnessed the incident and having given a statement to that effect to the
police and turned hostile to the Prosecution case. He deposed that the since
deceased was taken to the funeral cite from the hospital in his ambulance. On
specific question put forth by the Learned APP, he denied having stated to the
police that he witnessed the incident on his way back from a post-death ceremony
and that it was on account of the rashness and negligence of the driver of the said
Auto.

PW4, the Investigating Officer deposed that he is acquainted with the
signature and handwriting of CW12, his colleague and identified his signatures in
Exhibit P1 and Exhibit P4 FIR. He deposed that he took over the investigation,
completed the inquest proceedings and produced Exhibit PS Inquest Report and
also Exhibit P6 Postmortem Certificate issued by CW11 before this Court, He had
visited the place of occurrence, inspected the same and prepared Exhibit P7 Scene
Mahazar; according to which, the place of occurrence is the portion of the tar road,
1 meter 40 centimeters eastwards from the west tar end of Killipalam-Thampanoor

Exhibit P8 notice and Exhibit P6(a) reply notice: prepared Exhibit P9 Vehicle

also produced by him. The arrest of the Accused was recorded by him and the
Accused was enlarged on Exhibit P12 bail bond and Exhibit P14 is the report
reflecting the details of the Accused. Exhibit P15 is the report reflecting that on
investigation, offence punishable under Section 3(1) r/w 181 of the MV Act is also
involved in this case. He deposed that he completed the investigation and
submitted the final report and could identify the Accused.

This Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and
considered the submissions of the respective parties. On going through the
 5

evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1 does not have any direct
knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the witnesses who
claimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of the Prosecution.
‘The contradictions in the deposition of the occurrence witness is not proved as and
the same have not been put to the Investigating Officer, when he mounted the box.
‘The deposition of PW1 cannot be admitted in evidence as the same is only hearsay.
‘The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned Assistant Public
Prosecutor. There is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the
witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused
had driven the autorickshaw in a rash and negligent manner, causing the injured
to succumb to his injuries. Nothing has been brought out in evidence to the effect
to prove the ingredients of the offences alleged. The Prosecution has failed to
‘substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the
guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c) are found in
favour of the Accused.

9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found
in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

10, In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 304 A of the IPC and 3(1) r/w 181 of MV
Act Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of
CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
