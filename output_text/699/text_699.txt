ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure ("the Code” for brevity).

2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C.No.574 of 2018
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg. In

the s

case, he stands indicted for having committed offence
punishable under Section 420 of the IPC. The 1* respondent is the de

facto complainant.

3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the
proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The 1*
respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not wish to

continue with the prosecution proceedings against the petitioner.

4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statement of the 1 respondent has been recorded and the
State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no

public interest.
 4e1.We.No. 0513 of 2018 s 219KERISS

5. I have considered the submissions advanced.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the
‘Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court
can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the

victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.

7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to
be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.
It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious
impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on
account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends
of justice, Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be
nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak.
Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the
considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its
extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the

proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A1 Final
 219KERISS

Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner in
C.C.No.574 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-II, Hosdurg are quashed.
