2024KERIAOO1

ORDER
This Cri.M.C. under Section 482 of CrP.C. is at the

instance of the complainant in Annexure-A2 complaint on
the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, North
Paravur, for quashing Annexure-A1 order dated 08.12.2023
and to forward Annexure-A2 complaint to SHO, Vadakkekara
Police Station for investigation under Section 156(3) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

2. The petitioner filed a private complaint, against the
respondents therein, as MP No.5998 of 2023, alleging that
they deployed minor school children for collecting amounts
for the centenary celebrations of SNMHS, Moothakunnam.
His prayer in the complaint was to forward the complaint for

investigation to SHO, Vadakkekara, under Se«

n 156(3) of
CrP.C. But as per Annexure-A1 order, learned Magistrate
posted it for taking sworn statement of the petitioner/
complainant, stating that, investigation by the Police was not

necessary.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that
several documents are to be collected and witnesses are to
be questioned and that has to be done only through proper
investigation done by Police. So, it was absolutely necessary
to get the investigation done through SHO, Vadakkekara
Police Station, and Annexure-A1 order, by which, the MP was
posted for sworn statement of the petitioner, and also the
finding that investigation by Police was not necessary, are
liable to be set aside.

4. Adverting to the facts and circumstances, and also
‘on hearing the submissions made at the Bar, this Court is of
the view that Annexure-A2 complaint filed by the
complainant ought to have been forwarded to SHO,
Vadakkekara Police Station, for investigation and report.
Learned Magistrate, without assigning any specific reasons,
could not have jumped into a conclusion that investigation
by Police was not necessary, when the case of the
complainant was that several documents have to be

collected and several witnesses were to be questioned to
 CHLM,CNo.484/2024 4

bring out the real state of affairs. So this Court is inclined to
set aside Annexure-A1 order dated 08.12.2023 and to direct
the learned Magistrate to forward Annexure-A2 complaint to
SHO, Vadakkekara Police Station for investigation and
report.
The Cri.M.C. stands allowed accordingly.
