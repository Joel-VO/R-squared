Petitioner alleges that Crime No.7/2024 of Vellayil Police Station,
Kozhikode District, has been registered under Section 57 of the Kerala Police

2. According to the petitioner, the missing person is she herself and
that she is residing with her friend on her own volition without any
compulsion and she is not missing from any place. Though her presence
either before the Police Station or the Jurisdictional Magistrate would suffice
to close the crime, she apprehends repercussions from the locals.

appearance of the petitioner before the Police Station would not create any
issues and that her presence is necessary for the progress of the
investigation

4, In view of the above, petitioner shall appear within ten days from
today before the Station House Officer, Vellayil Police Station, Kozhikode
District, in order to conclude the investigation. However, if the petitioner
apprehends any action from any quarters, necessarily, appropriate and
effective protection shall be granted to her by the Station House Officer of
Vellayil Police Station,

CrLM.C. is disposed of as above.
