‘ORDER

Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.c.

2. Petitioner was the first accused in
S.C.No.597 of 2016 on the file of the Asst. Sessions
Judge, Manjeri. He and the co-accused allegedly
committed the offences under Sections 364 and 392
IPC. As the petitioner was absconding, only the
others were tried. They were acquitted by Annexure-B
judgment. Later the petitioner surrendered and his
case is now pending as $.C.No.5 of 2019. The
proceedings are sought to be quashed in the light of
the acquittal of the co-accused. Moreover, the
matter has been settled. The first respondent is the
victim,

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner
and the learned Public Prosecutor.

4. I am satisfied that the trial of the
petitioner will not serve any purpose since the co-

accused has been acquitted and the matter has been
 20191KERII2DS

CeL.MC.No. 8655 of 2018 3
settled.
In the result, this Crl.M.c is allowed. The

proceedings in S.C.No.5 of 2019 on the file of the
Asst. Sessions Judge, Manjeri are quashed. If any
material objects have been produced in this case, the
trial court may pass appropriate orders for their
disposal.
