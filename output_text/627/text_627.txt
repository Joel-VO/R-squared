‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 7761 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2017
ORDER
The petitioner herein is the accused in O.R.No.1/2012 of DRI,
Calicut for offence punishable under Section 135 of the Customs
‘Act, 1962. In the above case, the allegation was that, the
petitioner herein had transported to India 3.5 kgs of gold from
abroad. He was granted bail by Annexure 1 order inter alia on a
condition that the original passport of the accused shall not be
released by the DRI till the trial is over. Subsequently by an order
of this Court in Cri.M.C. No.2644/2013, a copy of which is
produced as Annexure 2, this Court reiterated that the passport
cannot be released, since using the very same passport he had
illegally imported 3.5 kgs of gold to India. The matter is still
pending before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (E.0),
Ernakulam.
Hence, | feel that time is not ripe for releasing the passport.
Cri.M.C. fails and is dismissed.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
