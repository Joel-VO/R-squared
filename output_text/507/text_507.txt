THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

Ce1.MC,No.5722 OF 2020(E)

ORDER

Dated this the 7th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime
No.610/2013 registered at the Pathanamthitta Police
Station for the offence punishable under Section 13
rlw S.17 of the Kerala Money Lenders Act, now
pending as C.C.No1149/2013 on the files of the
Judicial First. Class Magistrate Court-1,
Pathanamthitta. The de facto complainant and the
other aggrieved person are arrayed as respondents 3
and 4. Annexures-A2 and A3 affidavits have been
filed by the said respondents stating that the dispute,
which was the reason for the incident and
registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably

and they have no subsisting grievance against the
 22UKERIII26

Ce1.MC,No.5722 OF 2020(E)

petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners
have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 and 4,
the contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled
and no public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote.
As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount
to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of
the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme
Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab

{(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of
 Ce1.MC,No.5722 OF 2020(E) 202UKERINII6

Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is
no impediment in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in C.C.No1149/2013 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,

Pathanamthitta is quashed.
