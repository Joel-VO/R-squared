THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 (CRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 2 2020/KERIIZ7S

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

The petitioner is the 3" accused in C.C.No.10
of 2018 on the file of the Chief Judicial
Magistrate Court, Kottayam.

2. The above case was taken on file based on
Annexure-A private complaint.

3. The case of the complainant is that,
accused Nos.1 and 2 forged the signature of one
N.T. Francis, brother of accused No.1 and the 1*
respondent on two vakalathnamas filed before the
Sub Court, Kottayam on its transfer from Sub
Court, Pala, The learned Magistrate took
cognizance for the offences under Sections 468
and 471 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The
prayer in this petition is to quash the
proceedings against the petitioner.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.
 (CRL.M.C.No. 4992 of 2019 3 202UKERIITS
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that, the 1° accused in Annexure-A
complaint approached this Court for quashing the

proceedings and as per the order dated 17.1.2019

in Crl.M.C.No.5812 of 2018 this Court quashed the

entire proceedings against the 1% accused. The
counsel submitted that, in the light of the
above judgment, the substratum of this case
destroyed and the continuance of the prosecution
against the petitioner herein is an abuse of
process of law.

6. After hearing both sides, I think, there
is some force in the argument of the petitioner.
This Court, after considering the entire aspects,
quashed the proceedings against the 1% accused
as per the judgment dated 17.1.2019 in
Crl.M.C.No.5812 of 2018. The relevant portion of

the judgment is extracted hereunder:

“5. I have perused Annexure-Q complaint
and Annexure-R sworn statement of the first

respondent given under section 200 Cr.P.C. In
 (CRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 ‘ 2020KERIIIS

the complaint it is stated that the vakalaths
allegedly containing the forged signature of
Francis were sent for examination and the
first respondent knew that the signatures are
not genuine. This is strange. The vakalths
have been in the custody of the Sub Court.
How the first respondent could send it for
examination. And it is not disclosed who sent
them or to whom they were sent for
‘examination.

6. In the Annexure-R sworn statement the
first respondent has no case of sending the
vakalaths for examination. In Annexure-Q
complaint it is stated that petitioner forged
the signatures of the Francis in the
vakalaths and handed them to his advocate. It
is not disclosed how he came to know about
it.

- In Annexure-Q complaint it is stated
that Francis is an alshimers patient, he
cannot remember even his name and cannot
recognize any one. Sworn statement of one
Dr.Joseph Sebastian was recorded during the
enquiry. He stated that since April 2015
Francis has been under his treatment for
alshimers and loss of memory and inability to
do things properly are its characteristics.
The vakalaths in the Sub Court were executed
on 02.03.2016 and 08.02.2017.

8. Merely because Francis is an

alshimers patient it cannot be said that the
 (CRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 s 2020KERIIIS

signatures in the vakalath are not genuine.
The only allegation in the sworn statement of
the first respondent is that the Francis is
an alshimers patient, he is laid up and he
cannot recognize anyone. That is the only
basis for him to allege that the signatures
of Francis are not genuine. The doctor has no
case that Francis was not able to put his
signature. What he has said is that Francis
cannot understand the nature of the documents
he execute. That may may be a good reason to
hold that the vakalath is not valid, but not
@ good reason to take the view that the
signature in it is not genuine.

The complaint was filed when the
suits came up for trial. The first respondent
filed Annexure N and 0 applications in the
Sub Court, Kottayam to appoint the petitioner
guardian of Francis. This is very significant
in nature of the case. In Annexure-N and 0
affidavit the first said that the petitioner
"has no interest adverse to the interest" of

Francis and they filed joint written
statement. While the two suits were pending
in the Sub Court, Pala the first respondent
filed an affidavit stating that Francis
forged his (first respondent’s) signature in
a settlement deed.

10. The discussion made above compels me
to hold that there are no sufficient grounds
to proceed with the complaint. It is liable
 (CRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 ‘ 2020/KERIIZ7S

to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.cC is allowed.
The proceedings in C.C.No.10 of 2018 on the
file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court
Kottayam are quashed so far as the petitioner

is concerned.”

7, In the light of the above finding of this
Court, I think, the prosecution against the
petitioner is an abuse of process of law.
Therefore, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. All
further proceedings against the petitioner in
C.C.No.10 of 2018 on the file of the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court, Kottayam are quashed.
