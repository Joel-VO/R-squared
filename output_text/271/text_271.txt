Ce1.MC,No.1530 OF 2020(A)

ORDER
Dated this the 6th day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 and 7 in
Crime No.3/2020 registered at the Eravipuram Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections 143,
147, 148, 341, 294(b), 506, 323, 324, 307 r/w 149 of
IPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the
crime was registered, is arrayed as the 3”
respondent. Annexure-A3 affidavit has been filed by
3" respondent stating that the dispute, which was the
reason for the incident and registration of the crime,
has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting
grievance against the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners

have no criminal antecedents.

Ce1.MC,No.1530 OF 2020(A)

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavit filed by the 3" respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
no public interest is involved in this matter. Though,
there is an allegation that the petitioners have
committed offence under Section 307 of IPC, perusal
of the wound certificate shows that the reason of the
the injury was stated to a road traffic accident. In
Annexure-A2 order, by which this Court had granted
bail to the petitioners also observed that the
petitioners had suffered a lacerated wound which
coincides with the story of the injury being sustained
in the road traffic accident. Moreover, in view of the
settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings

ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance
 Ce1.MC,No.1530 OF 2020(A) Be a0nuKERT00

of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process
of court and hence, in view of the legal position set
out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan
Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC
582] and Gian Singh v, State of Punjab and
another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment
in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure-
Al FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.3/2020
registered at the Eravipuram Police Station is
quashed.
