The petition is filed under Section 482 cr.Pc
for quashing the proceedings in CC No.2256/2016 on

quashed on the ground that the petitioner is shown
as the accused in the case not by his name but by
his official capacity as the Divisional chief
Executive of the Tobacco Division of M/s. ITC Ltd.
The Company has not been impleaded. This Court
had earlier considered the very same prayer of the
petitioner in Crl. MC No.6587/2019 and vide order
reported in 2019 (4) KLT 257 [Divisional chief
Executive, Tobacco Division, ITC Ltd. v. State of
 2n20KERDNT

Kerala], and by a detailed order quashed the
proceedings as against the petitioner. The facts
and the allegations against the petitioner are
similar. The only difference is that in the
decided case, the proceedings were pending before
the judicial First Class Magistrate's court,
Thrissur, whereas herein the proceedings are
pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court, Irinjalakkuda. In view of the
decision taken by this Court in 2019 (4) KLT 257,
the very same order will have to be passed in this
case as well.

against the petitioner in CC No.2256/2016 on the
files of the judicial First Class Magistrate's
court, Trinjalakkuda shall stand quashed under
