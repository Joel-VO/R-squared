SUNIL THOMAS, J.
CHLM.C.No. 7534 of 2016
Dated this the 3% day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner is the accused in C.C No.430/2010 of JFCM
Court, Ponnani. The crime was registered for offences punishable
under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. On the basis of a complaint that accused on 11/2/2007
attacked the defacto complainant and her family members crime
was registered on 12/2/2007, Annexure Al final report was
submitted only on 8/6/2010. Contending that the final report, was
submitted clearly beyond the period of limitation prescribed under
Section 468 of Cr.P.C. and is liable to be quashed, the petitioners
have approached this Court for quashing Annexure Al final report.
An application was filed before the court below raising the above
contentions which was rejected by the court below by Ext.P1 order.

3, Perusal of the available records, indicate that though FIR
was registered on 12/2/2007, after investigation the final report
was laid only on 8/6/2010. The learned counsel contended that
this was beyond the limitation period as prescribed under Section
468 Cr-P.C. Learned counsel relied on the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Udai Shankar Awasthi v. State of U.P.&
 2017KERISS

CeMCNo.7534/2016 2
Another {2013 KHC 4025) wherein it was held that law of
limitation prescribed under the Cr.P.C. must be observed. But, in
certain exceptional circumstances, taking into consideration the
gravity of the charge, the Court may condone delay, recording
reasons for the same, in the event that it is found necessary to
condone such delay in the interest of justice.

4. The question of limitation was considered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Darsan Singh Saini v. Soham Singh ((2016)
2 SCC ( Crl.) 418) wherein it was held that limitation under
Section 468 Cr.P.C.has to be reckoned with reference to the date of
incident and date of complaint. The Hon'ble Supreme Court relied
on the authoritative pronouncement of the Constitution Bench in
Sarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases ( 2014
) 2 SCC 62 wherein the Supreme Court held that for the purpose

of computing limitation under section 468 Cr-P.C., the relevant

date is the date of filing the complaint or the date of presentation
and not the date on which Magistrate took cognizance. Hence, the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner in this case is,
not legally sustainable.

5. In the light of the above , I find no illegality, infirmity in the
findings of the court below in Ext.P1. Hence, it is liable to be
confirmed. I also find no reason to invoke the jurisdiction of this
Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.to quash the proceedings

before the court below.

In the result, Cr.M.C.is dismissed,
