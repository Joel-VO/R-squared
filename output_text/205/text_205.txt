CrLM.C No. 284 of 2024

Dated this the 19° day of January, 2024

ORDER

‘The first petitioner is the registered owner of a tipper
lorry bearing register No. KL-24-B-6817 while the 2”
petitioner is the owner of lorry bearing No.KL-23-D-2520. Both
the above vehicles were seized by the 3% respondent on
08-01-2024 alleging offences punishable under Sections 4()
and 21 of the Kerala Minor Mineral (Regulation of Development)
‘Act 1957 (for short, ‘the Act’). However, the said setzure has not
been reported to the learned Magistrate under Section 102 of
CrPC and instead has been reported to the 3 respondent,

who is the Competent Officer under the Act.

2. Sri.Ajith Murali, the learned counsel for the petitioner,
contended that the failure to report the seizure to the
Magistrate is contrary to law and that the 3rd respondent

‘ought to have reported the same.

3, In the decision in Crl.M.C.No.1484/2023, this Court
considered the question as to whether the seizure ought to be
reported to the Magistrate. After observing that there are no

contrary provisions in the Act as against Section 102 Cr.P.C.., it

was observed that the Police Officers are bound to report the

factum of seizure without delay to the Magistrate.

4. The selzure of the two vehicles have not been reported
to the Magistrate yet and the 3" respondent is bound to do so

as per law.

5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the 3°
respondent to report the seizure of vehicle Nos. KL-24-B-6817
and No.KL-23-D-2520 to the jurisdictional Magistrate, as
expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a period of 48

hours from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment,

‘The CrLM.C.is disposed of.
