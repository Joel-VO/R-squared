P.8.70 JUDGE
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018

ORDER

It has been reported that even though the
proceedings were initiated against the petitioner under
Section 379 IPC and Section 20 of the Kerala Protection of
River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001,
‘on chemical analysis, the sand involved was proved to be
ordinary sand and not river sand. Matters being so, the final
report in Crime No.917/2016 of Hosdurg Police Station is
not legally sustainable and the same is liable to be quashed.
Therefore, Annexure-A2 order passed by the court below is
also liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the final
report in Crime No.917/2016 of Hosdurg Police Station and
Annexure-A2 order are quashed.
