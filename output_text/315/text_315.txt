K. HARILAL, J.

Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER
The petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 respectively in
Crime No.364 of 2012 of Payyavoor Police Station, Kannur
District, registered for the offences punishable under Sections
341 and 323 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The petitioners entered appearance on receipt of

summons before the court below through a counsel. Since the
petitioners were not in station thereafter, they could not
appear before the court below on hearing dates. Now the non-
bailable warrant has been issued against the petitioners by the
court below. Now the petitioners are ready to surrender before
the court below to seek regular bail. Apprehension of the
petitioners is that if he surrenders before the court below, he
will be remanded to the judicial custody, pending consideration

of the application.

I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand

the petitioners mechanically, without application of mind.
Nonetheless, the learned magistrate is directed to consider and
dispose of the bail application to be filed by the petitioners on

the date of surrender itself.
