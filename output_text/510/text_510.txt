CRLM.C. Nos. 5769 & 5781 of 2017

Dated this the 8" day of December, 2017

ORDER

There was a delay in filing income tax return in these
matters. According to the petitioners, the delay was not
willful; whereas, the Department says that the delay was
willful. According to the Department, the delay was willful in
the sense that it was also a modus operandi to avoid the
payment of tax. The learned counsel for the petitioners has
pointed out that the petitioners were suffering from utter
financial stringency and therefore, the return could not be
filed in time. The return could be filed only on uploading the
payment of the admitted tax. They were not in a position to
pay the admitted tax and that is the reason why the delay
had occurred.

2. Huge amounts were imposed on the petitioners

as penalty. Of course, in case of such willful delay, and
 CCRLM.C.Nos. $769 & 5781 of 2017

concealment of income, it is for the Department to take such
measures.

3. Now, an appeal has been filed and the matter is
pending adjudication. In the mean time, the petitioners had
approached this Court and the matters in the appeal stands
stayed by the orders of this Court as is evident from
Annexure N in Cri.M.C. No.5769 of 2017. In a similar
situation this Court had occasion to pass Annexure O order
in Crl.M.C.No.5769/2017. In this particular situation, this
Court is of the view that the prosecution proceedings before
the court below in these matters shall stand stayed, till the
disposal of the appeal.

In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are disposed of by
ordering that the prosecution proceedings before the court
below in these matters shall stand stayed till the disposal of

the appeal.
