ORDER

The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C. No.705/2017 of

No.334/2017 of Nilambur Police Station for offences punishable
under Sections 451, 323, 324, 341 & 354 IPC. It was alleged by
the prosecution that on 02.08.2017 at 3.40 p.m., the accused
trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant and tore
her dress with the intention of outraging her modesty. Pursuant
to the complaint lodged, crime was registered. After investigation
final report was filed.

2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending
that the dispute has been settled between the parties and no
further grievance survives. Annexures A2 to AS are the affidavits
sworn to by the respondents 2 to 5 reiterating the settlement.
Learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 5 submitted that the
parties have resolved their disputes and no further grievance
survives.

3. Having considered these facts, | am inclined to invoke
