registered.

18, Evaluation of the evidence ; The prosecution case is that Accused no.1 t0 4

committed robbery of gold omaments and cash from CW1 .The specific
allegation against the accused no.5 is that he had received 26 grams of gold
‘worth Rs.11000/- with the knowledge that the same was stolen property and
admitted other accused persons to conceal the gold. The prosecution has no
‘case that the accused no.5 had taken part in the commission of robbery that has
committed by accused no. 1 to 4. The only allegation against accused No.5 is

ws. 414 of Indian Penal Code, 1860.

19. 8.414 of I concealment of

in Penal Code provides that 414, Assis

stolen property—
Whoever voluntarily assists in concealing or disposing of or making away with
property which he knows or has reason to believe to be stolen property, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend

to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In order to prove the offence w/s.414 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 the

prosecution has to prove that
 10 016
1) that the property involved in the offence is stolen property

2) the accused voluntarily assisted someone in concealing or disposing of or
‘making away with the such property

3) The accused had the knowledge and reason to believe that the property was
stolen

‘That in order to attract the offence w/s.414 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 what
the prosecution has to prove is that the accused has voluntarily assisted in
stealing or disposing or making away with the property which he knows or has
the reason to believe to be a stolen property .The person who had received
stolen property will not be come w/s.414 asper the provisions of S.414 of IPC
but the person who assisted the concealment or disposal will only come under
the ambit of Sec, 414 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, Another aspect is that the
prosecution has to prove that the property which was stolen and property which

‘was recovered are identical .

20. In Ajendranath v. State of MP 1963 KHC 408, the essential ingredients of
8.414 of IPC , observed by honourable apex court as follows.
“Lastly, it was also urged that even if the identity of the articles recovered with
the articles stolen be established, no offence under S. 414 IPC, is made out

against the appellant as the other accused have been acquitted and it is not
 2

ot 16
known whom the appellant is supposed to have helped in concealing the stolen

property. S. 414 IPC makes it an offence for a person to assist voluntarily in
stealing or disposing of or making away with property which he knows or has
reason to believe to be stolen property. It is not necessary for a person to be
convicted under S. 414 IPC, that another person must be traced out convicted
of an offence of committing theft. The prosecution has simply to establish
that the propety recovered is stolen property and that the appellant provided

help in its concealment and disposal.

Now let’s examine the evidence of prosecution .S.Gopakumar who was
examined as PW1 had only hearsay knowledge regarding the
incident According to him on getting the information that a robbery he went to
Balaramapuram police station and found his father there .PW2 Padmanabhan
‘was examined by the prosecution to prove the stock register balance of the said
shop on that particular day PW 7 Naneswar was examined by the prosecution
to prove the recovery of MOI gold ingot which is weighed 55.500 gm which
according to him was purchased from one suresh who was not the accused

PW8, Visweswaran identified the gold chain marked as MO2 ,which was given
by him to the police .PW9 R.S Vinod identified his signature in the Ext pl
mahasar .PW18 Thampi deposed that at the time of preparing Ext P8
‘mahasar ,the police produced some other person and not the accused .Allother

‘witnesses were examined by the prosecution to prove the recovery of gold
 12016
‘ornaments upon the information given by the accused persons. There is

nothing in the evidence of PW1 to PW28 to exhibit that accused No. 5 has
concealed the gold ornaments. There is no other direct evidence to show that
the accused was assisted in concealing the gold ornaments .PW29 Shaji was
the sub inspector during the time of incident He deposed that asper the
confession made by the first accused that he entrusted gold ornaments to
accused no.6 Sadanandan he questioned him and accused no.6 stated that he
entrusted it to Noval Prasad, who is arrayed as 5* accused . Later based on the
confession of him the gold ornaments of 15.700 gm were recovered from one
Mr-Thankappan as per Ext P17 recovery mahasar .The relevant portion of

information that given to the police was marked as Ext P 17 (a) is extracted as
follows “aseiavd amos a aomvacmge onomusaom cyaaily agmno

UEMADAy MAKAJo aKMEApu mga aidqROS MSG_M oes

nomads 11000/- @ni08" oaogam 0700526 mvs oven” He further

deposed that he registered the Ext P18 FIR against the present accused . On
analysing the evidence ,it can be seen that apart from the evidence of PW29
that a recovery has been effected by him ,no other evidence pertaining to the
allegation that the accused assisted in concealing the gold omaments -The said
‘Thankappan was not examined by the prosecution Moreover the gold
‘ornaments which alleged as recovered was not identified by the PW29 or by
any other witnesses.In fact the prosecution has not proved that the gold

‘ormaments that were recovered as per Ext P17 from CW30 Thankappan and the
 13 0f 16
gold ornaments that alleged as robbed are one and the same . In short there is,

no direct evidence or any other circumstantial evidence to prove that the
present accused assisted the other accused persons to conceal the gold
‘omaments . The available evidence on record is hardly sufficient to find that
the accused no.5 committed any offence ws.414 of IPC as alleged by the

prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt .

). Point No.3 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 and 2, the accused No.5 is
found not guilty of offence punishable under sections 414 of Indian Penal
Code, 1860 and he is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973. His bail bonds stand cancelled and he is set at
liberty.

‘Case against Accused No.4 is split up and refiled as CC.446/2002.

‘The material objects were produced before this court will be destroyed after the

appeal period is over according to law
