THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2021

Petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure.

2. Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 5 in
Crime No.1175 of 2020 of Quilandy Police Station
registered for the offences punishable under
Sections 406, 498(A)and 34 of Indian Penal Code.

3. The learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners have submitted that the first
petitioner, who is the first accused has married
the defacto complainant and they resided together
as husband and wife for sometime. But due to the
difference of opinion, they separated and
subsequently their marriage has been dissolved by a
decree of divorce by the Family Court, Vadakara in
0.P.No.482 of 2020.

4, It is also submitted that now the entire

dispute between the parties have been settled out
 ceL.me.we.5809 oF 2020 2021KERAGS

of court and all her belongings have been returned
to her as per the terms of the settlement.
Therefore, it is quite unnecessary to proceed with
the case registered against the petitioners on some
misunderstanding by the defacto complainant.

5. Heard the learned counsel for the
petitioners, respondent as well the learned Public
Prosecutor.

6. The learned Public Prosecutor has also
submitted that the entire dispute between the
parties have been amicably settled and as such the
defacto complainant has no grievance or complaints
against these petitioners.

7. On going through the entire records
produced by the petitioners as well on hearing both
sides, I find that no fruitful purpose is likely to
be served by pursuing the matter against these
petitioners. | Moreover, no public interest is
involved in the case and there is no legal
impediment in granting the prayer as sought for by

the petitioners. As, the entire dispute has been
 22UKERIS

5
amicably settled the request to quash the FIR
registered against these petitioners can be allowed
as prayed for by the petitioners.

For the foregoing reasons, this Crl.M.C is
allowed and Crime No.1175 of 2020 of Quilandy
Police Station registered against these petitioners

shall stand quashed as prayed for.
