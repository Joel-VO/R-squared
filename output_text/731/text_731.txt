TRIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION OW
07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 ORDER
Dated this the 7th day of January 2020

The petitioner is the 1 accused in
S.C.No.865/2017 on the file of the Assistant Sessions
Court, Thalassery, for having allegedly committed the
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,
324, 308 and 427 read with Section 149 of I.P.C.
along with some other accused. The petitioner was
absconding and the trial proceeded against the co-
accused, who according to the petitioner, was found
to be not guilty and acquitted. The only injured
is the 2™ respondent herein, who has appeared through
a Counsel and has filed an affidavit stating that the
matter has been amicably settled and he has no
existing grievance against the petitioner. A report
has been filed by the investigating officer through
the Senior Public Prosecutor to that effect. The
petitioner does not have any criminal antecedents and
no public interest is involved and the co-accused
were acquitted. Under the circumstances, no purpose

will be served by proceeding against the petitioner.
 In the result, the Crl.M.c. is allowed and the
entire proceedings in $.C.No.865/2017 on the file of
the Assistant Sessions Court, Thalassery, stands
quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and the
petitioner is discharged.
