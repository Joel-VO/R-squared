Onder Accused is discharged under Section 245(2) of
the CPC of the above offences under

Sections 323, and 506(ii) of the IPC r/w Section
31 of the DV Act.

This case having come up for consideration before this Court on 18.11.2024,
this Court on the same day passes the following:

ORDER

1, This case arose on a Private Complaint filed by the Complainant alleging
‘commission of the offences under Sections 323, and 506(i) of the IPC r/w Section 31
‘of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to
as the DV Act’) against the Accused person, who is the husband of the Complainant,
‘The Complaint was taken on file against Accused for the above offences vide Order
of this Court dated 21.05.2022

2. This case is in the stage of pre-charge enquiry, ie. posted evidence of
Complainant under Section 244 CrPC since 30.01.2024. On 31.05.2024, though the

 Complainant was represented, time was granted for adducing the evidence. The

‘on 08.08.2024,
24.08.2024, 19.10.2024, 15.11.2024 and finally on 18.11.2024. However, the Accused

Complainant was absent continuously on subsequent postings, i,

fas duly represented by his Counsel and he was present as well. Notice was issued
to the Complainant on 24.08.2024 and on account of her non-appearance registered
notice was issued on 19.10.2024 requiring her appearance before this Court and
intitmating the next posting date. On 15.11.2024, the Acknowledgment Card returned
served with the sign and name of the Complainant. A fair opportunity was however
‘granted for her appearance further and the case was adjourned as ‘No Further Time’
to 18.11.2024 and notice also issued to the Counsel appearing on her behalf. On the
said date, the Learned Counsel for the Complainant submitted that he no more holds
her Vakalat and the Complainant was also absent. The Accused was present before
this Court

3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities to
the Complainant to adduce evidence as elucidated above, when the matter was taken
up this day, the Complainant remained absent. There was no representation for the
Complainant and the Counsel submitted that he no more appears on behalf of the
Complainant. The Accused! was present and represented by their Counsel. Neither is
the Complainant present before this Court nor is she represented by her Counsel and

1no bonafide reason stated for the non-appearance of the Complainant.

It is well settled that a Complainant seeking to formulate a charge against
accused is bound to adduce evidence in support of his case at the stage of pre -
charge enquiry since evidence already recorded by the Court under Sections 200 and
202 of CrPC is not admissible in evidence nor binding on the Accused. Neglect of the
complainant to proceed with the enquiry and adduce evidence must be reckoned by
the Magistrate to be a situation where the complainant lacked necessary materials in
support of accusation and therefore the proposed charge is groundless. (See
‘Rahmath v. State of Kerala and Others, 2020 (4) KHC 90)
 From a careful consideration of the records in this case and the conduct of the
Complainant, it appears to this Court that the Complainant does not intend to

proceed with the above matter. This Court is satisfied the Complainant has neglected

to participate in the pre-charge enquiry despite umpteen opportunities granted to
hhim to adduce evidence in support of his case and that he has failed, for no good
reasons in adducing the evidence requisite for formulating charge against the
Accused. The reason for his non-appearance is unexplained. Even if itis taken into
account that she is no more represented by the Counsel who held her vakalat,
according to his submission; it is seen that despite having served with the notice,
there is non-appearance on the part of the Complainant before this Court.

In wake of above circumstances, this Court does not find any other reason to
proceed with the matter further, as continuation of the proceeding any longer, in
absence of Complainant at this stage would remain only a futile exercise and would
cause serious prejudice to the Accused. The neglect on part of the Complainant to
adduce evidence under Section 244 CrPC when read in conjunction with the
unexplained reason for his absence can only lead to the conclusion that she lacks
‘materials in support of his accusation and that the proposed charge is groundless.
Hence the Accused persons are discharged of the aforesaid offences under Section
245(2) of the CrP.

4. Resultantly, the Accused is discharged under Section 245(2) of the CrPC of the
above offences under Sections 323, and 506(i) of the IPC r/w Section 31 of the DV
Act

Pronounced in open court on this the 18° day of November, 2024.
