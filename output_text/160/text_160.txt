THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

P.UBAID, J.

Cri.M.C No.165 of 2015

Dated this the 12 January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused Nos.12 and 13
in C.C No.127 of 2009 before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Kothamangalam. When they failed to
appear in court consistently, the learned Magistrate issued
warrant of arrest against them. It is submitted that the

petitioners are in fact on bail. On the apprehension of

remand to judicial custody on surrender, the petitioners
seek orders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure directing the court below to recall the warrant of
arrest on surrender. Of course, the learned Magistrate,
who has issued warrant of arrest for proper reasons, will
have to consider the request for recalling the warrant. 1
do not think that the learned Magistrate will mechanically
remand the petitioners to judicial custody when they
surrender and make application for bail, if their bail stands

cancelled. The trial court will have to consider the

grievance of the petitioners regarding their absence on the
 201SKERIII64
Cri.M.C No.165 of 2015

day.

In the result, this petition is closed with direction to the
court below that in case application for bail is filed by the
petitioners on surrender in C.C No.127 of 2009, the same
shall be judiciously considered, and appropriate decision
regarding bail shall be taken by the learned Magistrate on

the date of surrender itself.
