Crl.M.C.No.3704 of 2013

Dated this the 13" day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner is an accused in C.C.No.563/2010 before
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara. The
facts shorn of unnecessary details are as follows:

The petitioner is an Assistant Postmaster. During the
period 31.8.2005 to 3.6.2006, he was on the charge of
Postmaster. During the said period he availed a housing
loan of Rs.5,25,000/- from Canara Bank, for which, he
produced certain documents. When he defaulted the
repayments, the Bank authorities contacted the Postal
Superintendent and found that the salary certificate
produced by the petitioner herein was a forged document.
Thereon, an oral complaint was made by the Senior
Manager of the Canara Bank, Orkkatteri branch before the
police. Thereon F.LR. No.565/2008 for offences under
Sections 420, 468 and 471 of IPC is seen registered. The
allegation is that for cheating the bank and obtaining the

loan amount, the forged documents are produced. After
 aorrmenni6

investigation, a charge was laid and the court took

cognizance of the offences and took the case on file as

C.C,No.563/2010 on the files of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Vadakara. Aggrieved by the said action of the
court in taking cognizance on the police charge, this
Crl.M.C. is filed for quashing the said proceedings.

2. When the petition came up for hearing, the
counsel for the petitioner submitted before me that even if
any offence is committed, that will only an offence under
Section 13 of P.C. Act and the local police got no
jurisdiction to take cognizance. It is also the submission that
the amount has already been remitted and at no stretch of
imagination can it be said that the salary certificate
produced was a forged one, when the petitioner was holding
the post of the Postmaster under charge.

3. I have herd the learned Public Prosecutor, who
submitted before me that here is not a case where any loss
sustained to the postal department. It is also submitted

before me that the officials of the bank never conspired with
 aormenn076
Cx.M.C.N0.3704 of 2013 5

the petitioner. Under such circumstances, the loss to the
bank is nothing to do with any act of the officials employed

by them and as there is no loss to the post office also, an
offence under Section 13 of P.C. Act is not committed by the
petitioner.

4. There is force in the submission of the Prosecutor.
Surely, whether actually a forgery was committed to
commit an offence under Section 420 of IPC is a fact to be
considered by the trial court. Surely, the case of the
petitioner is that he already paid and cleared the loan. This
being a warrant trial case, the petitioner is even entitled to
argue for a discharge, if so entitled. Thus, untrammeled by
any of the observations made herein, he is entitled to
contest his case before the trial court and even entitled to
argue for a discharge, if he is so legally entitled.

With the above observations, this petition dismissed.
