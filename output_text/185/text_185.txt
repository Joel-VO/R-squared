CRL.M.C. No. 212 of 2016

“Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018
ORDER

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

2. What is under challenge is the validity of the
analysis report of the food involved in C.C. No.567/2011 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-|, Aluva.

3. Relying on the decision reported in Pepsico
India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Food Inspector and
another[2010 (4) KLT 706 (SC)J, this Court in
Gopalakrishnan v. Food Inspector[2013 (3) KLT 455] had
held that the provisions under Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh)
of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act are mandatory

and the same are applicable to all the food items.
 CRLIM.C.No, 212 of 2016

4. The question involved in this case is the non
compliance of the mandatory provisions contained under
Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food
Adulteration Act. As there was a divergent view in the
matter, the decision in Gopalakrishnan(supra) along with
the other decisions of the learned Single Judges were
referred to the Division Bench. The Division Bench of this
Court in Cri.R.P. No. 1814/2002 considered the said question
and has disposed of the matter through order dated
17.11.2015, thereby upholding the view taken by this Court
in Gopalakrishnan(supra).

5. Matters being so, the continued prosecution of
the petitioners in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-1, Aluva, are illegal and no purpose
would be served in proceeding with the matter any further.
The matters involved in the said case are quite unnecessary
in view of the decisions noted supra and, therefore, the

same are liable to be quashed.
 2018KERZ00
CRLIM.C.No, 212 of 2016

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A1
complaint and all further proceedings initiated against the
petitioners in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate's Court-|, Aluva, are hereby quashed.
