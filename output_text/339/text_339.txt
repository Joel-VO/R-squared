Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016
Dated this the 11° day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the accused No.2 in Crime
No.407/2011 of Nadapuram Police Station in SC.No.1104
of 2014 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court,
Vatakara for offence punishable under Sections 143, 147,
148, 341, 323, 326, 427, 308 r/w Section 149 of the
Indian Penal Code.

2. According to the prosecution, on 21.08.2011
the petitioner along with several other persons formed
into an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of their
common object attacked the defacto complainant and
others. The first accused was pulled out of his car and hit
on the head with a stick. Crime was registered and after
investigation, final report was laid. All other accused
except the petitioner herein and accused No.2 faced the
trial before the court below. By Annexure-A3 judgment

all the accused who faced the trial were acquitted.
 20171KERIISO7

Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016

Contending that the petitioner herein is entitled for the
benefit of acquittal arrived at by the Sessions Court in
Annexure-A3 and that the substratum of the case is
broken in the light of the above finding, the petitioner

‘seeks to quash the proceedings.

Opposing the application the learned Public
Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is involved in few
other cases. It was further pointed out that the petitioner
herein remained absent for a long period and he is trying
to get a benefit of acquittal by the co-accused who faced
the trial. The learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned counsel for the second respondent-defacto
complainant submitted that, they have resolved their
disputes evidenced by Annexure-AS affidavit. It was
further pointed out that there were series of incident and
all the persons in the locality were roped in several
cases. Other cases in which the petitioner herein is
involved are the cases registered on the same day as a
sequel to the main case. I find some substance in that

contention. It is pertinent to note that in Annexure-A3
 20171KERIISO7

Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016 3

judgment, the court below had clearly arrived at a finding
that all the material witnesses failed to support the
prosecution and had not identified the accused. In the
light of above, I find that no purpose will be served by
prosecuting the petitioner herein, which can only result in
manifest injustice and mere waste of time. There is no
likelihood of the care ending in a successful conviction.
Though the allegation against the accused is serious
insofar as Sections 308 and 326 IPC are attributed. There
is no clear material to establish offence under Section 308
of IPC. Hence I am inclined to allow the Cri.M.C and all
the further proceedings SC.No.1104/2014 on the files of
the Assistant Sessions Court, Vatakara as against the

petitioner herein stands quashed.
