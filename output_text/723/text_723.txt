ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in CC No.145/2017 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod,
which has arisen from Crime No.11/2016 of Kasaragod
Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections
143, 147, 148, 341, 323 and 324 read with Section 149 IPC.

2, It seems that the matter has been amicably
settled between the petitioners and the de facto
complainant, who is the 2% respondent herein.
Respondents 3 to 6 are the other injured.

3. Respondents 2 to 6 have filed separate affidavits
as Annexures-A3 to A7 respectively, affirming that the matter
has been amicably settled between them and the petitioners

and presently, they have no complaints against the

petitioners. When the matter is settled between the parties,
no purpose would be served in proceeding with the matter

petitioners in CC No.145/2017 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, which has arisen from
Crime No.11/2016 of Kasaragod Police Station, can be
quashed.
