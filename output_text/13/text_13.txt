Crl.M.C No.12 of 2015

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2015

ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is the sole accused in S.T
No.8977/2010 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I,
North Paravur. The offences involved are under Sections 182
and 193 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner seeks orders
quashing the prosecution in view of the bar of cognizance under
Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The police
registered FIR in the case under Section 154 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, proceeded for investigation, and submitted
final report under Section 173(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. It appears that nobody advised the police regarding
cognizance and the bar of cognizance under Section 195 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. In view of the clear bar of
cognizance under Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
that no court shall take cognizance of such offence except on a
complaint in writing made by the proper person, this prosecution

cannot proceed. Accordingly, it is liable to be quashed under
 21SKERDID

caM.e No.2 02015 2
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as an
unsustainable one and a clear abuse of legal process.

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner herein in S.T

No.8977/2010 before the Judi

First Class Magistrate Court 1,
North Paravur, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will
stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any,

executed by him will stand discharged.
