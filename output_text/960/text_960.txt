‘This case having been finally heard on 30.01.2025 and this Court on the
04.02.2025 delivered the following: -
JUDGMENT.

1. This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of
Police, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 5085 of 2013 for the offences
punishable under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’) rw Section 134 (a) and (b) of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘MV Act’).

2. ‘The Prosecution allegation in brief js as follows: : The Accused herein,
arrayed as the 2" Accused in the Charge Sheet, is the driver of the TATA Ace van
bearing registration No. KL 27 C 3093. It is alleged that the unidentified 1st
Accused drove his unidentified car rashly, negligently and in a manner so as to
endanger the human life through Venpalavattam- Kazhakkoottam by-pass road on
24.08.2013 at 08:30 AM from south to North and hit on the backside of the
motorcycle bearing Registration No. KL 01 BL 8876 driven in the same direction
by the since deceased along with CW2 as it’s pillion rider, resulting in him to have
lost his control over the said vehicle. And thereafter, the motor cycle got hit by the
van driven by the Accused herein from the opposite direction, rashly, negligently
‘and in such a manner as to endanger the human life. The since deceased and CW2
fell on road. Since deceased suffered serious injuries in his abdomen etc., and CW2
also sustained injuries. The Ist Accused went away in his vehicle without providing
necessary medical aid and giving intimation to the police officials. The Accused
herein took them to the hospital along with CW6 and the since deceased

 3

succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment. Thus the Accused herein is
alleged to have committed the above said offences.

3. This Court took cognizance on the basis of the Final Report in respect of
offences under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the IPC r/w 134(a) and (b) of Motor
Vehicle Act. On issuance of process, the Accused herein entered appearance. He
‘was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies
of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of the
offences under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the IPC r/w 134(a) and (b) of Motor
Vehicle Act were read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty,
and claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1 to 4, 21 to 23 were examined as PWs 1
to 7 and Exhibits P1 to P7 marked. Exhibits P8 to P15 were marked subject to
proof. The presence of CWS and 7 could not be procured by the Prosecution and
Section 82 steps effected against CWS and report filed to the effect that presence
of CW7 cannot be procured in the near future.. The remaining witnesses were
given up by the Learned APP as the material witnesses turned hostile to the case of
Prosecution. The Accused denied all the incriminating circumstances agianst him
on his examination under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC. No Defence evidence was
adduced.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points
arise for consideration.

a, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a
manner endangering the life of injured causing injury to him and thereby
‘committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently
in a manner endangering the life and personal safety of the injured, causing
them hurt and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337
IPC as alleged?
 4

c. Has the accused failed to provide primary medical aid to the injured
as well as failed to inform the police, and thereby commit the offence
punishable 134 (a) and (b) of Motor Vehicles Act?

a If-so, the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and to avoid repetition,

PWI deposed that since deceased is his niece and he got information about
the incident over phone and visited him at Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.
He gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police.

PW2 deposed that he has no previous acquaintance with the since deceased
and that during 2013, at 08:00AM while he was travelling in scooter from
Kumarapuram to Kazhakkoottam, his scooter was overtaken by a car at Injakkal
highway and hit on the bike in front of him and went ahead without stopping the
vehicle. Teh person who had driven the bike fell on the right side of the road and
hhe was hit by a vehicle like a van and sustained injuries. He was taken to the
hospital in a car. There were two persons in the bike and he doesn’t know the
reason for the accident. He deposed that neither ke knows the numbers of those
car and can, nor the drivers. He denied of having given statement to the police to
the effect that it was on account of the negligence of the vehicles that the accident
took place.

PWs3 and 4, the occurrence witnesses denied having witnessed the incident
and also having given statement to the police to that effect.

PWS deposed that he registered the Exhibit P2 FIR. He further deposed that
CW2 also got injured in the incident. He admitted during his cross-examination
that nothing is reflected on the records to the effect that Tata Ace Goods vehicle is
having any connection with the alleged accident. PW6 is the Investigating Officer
‘and he deposed that he prepared Exhibit P3 Inquest Report and Exhibit P3 Scene
 5

Mahazar. He also admitted that during the Inquest no witnesses present therein
stated to the effect that Tata Ace Goods vehicle is having any connection with the
alleged accident, PW7 is the officer who took over the Investigation. He deposed
that he gave Exhibit P5 notice to the Accused for production of the latter's vehicle
to which Exhibit P5(a) reply was given. He deposed that he recorded the arrest of
the Accused and enlarged him on Exhibit PG Bail Bond and that Exhibit P7 is the
Address Report prepared by him. He prepared Exhibit P8 Vehicle Mahazar and
Exhibits P9 and P10 are the Inspection Reports of the Motor Vehicles Inspector.
Exhibits P11 and 12 are Third Party Bail Bonds. Exhibits P13 to P15 are the Scene
Plan, Wound Certificate and the Post Mortem Certificate respectively. He deposed
that the 1" Accused and the car could not be identified during the investigation.
He admitted the same during the Cross-Examination as well.

‘On going through the evidence and the materials on record, itis pertinent to
note that none of the occurrence witnesses have identified either the Accused or
his vehicle, The officials who have investigated the alleged offence admitted the
fact that the vehicle belonging to the Accused in fact have no connection with the
alleged crime. Although PW7 denied it, he admits not to have found the car that
had allegedly hit the bike or it's owner. PW3 the alleged injured himself turned
against the case of Prosecution by his denial as regards injuries sustained and the
Incident itself. PW2 also is not sure about the other vehicle that had hit the bike
nor could identify the Accused. Nothing has come out in evidence to the effect that
it was on account of the rashness or negligence of this Accused that the alleged
accident occured. Hence the ingredients of the offences under Sections 279, 337
‘and 304 A of the IPC doesn’t stand proved against the Accused herein,
Interestingly, even according to the Prosecution, the injured were taken to the
hospital in the vehicle of the Accused herein, as reflected in the Charge Sheet.
Hence the offences under Sections 134(a) and (b) of the MV Act also does not
stand proved against the Accused herein, for the twin reasons that; firstly, there is
no evidence forthcoming to the effect that it was the rash or negligent driving of
the vehicle of the Accused that had resulted in the accident and secondly, that it
 6

‘was in his vehicle that the injured were taken to the hospital even according to the
version of the Prosecution.

‘The Prosecution has thus failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper
evidence and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable
doubt, much less rash or negligent driving against him. Hence these points are
found in favour of the Accused.

9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found
in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 337, 304 A of the IPC and 134 (a) and (b)
of the MV Act. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section
255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
