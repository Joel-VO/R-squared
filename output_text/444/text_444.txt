Cri.M.C. No.4906 of 2016

Dated this the 3" day of August, 2016

ORDER

1.The petitioner is the accused in L.P.No.24 of 2012 on
the file of the Judicial First Cass Magistrate Court,
North Paravur. The said case has arisen from Crime
No.198 of 2003 of Vadakkekara Police Station
registered inter alia for the offence punishable under
sections 489(B), (C), 120(B) read with 34 of the IPC.

2.0n his failure to appear before the learned Magistrate,
non bailable warrant has been issued against him.
The petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate
directions to the learned Magistrate to consider his
application for recall of warrant and grant of bail on
the date of surrender itself and to grant him bail.

3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the

 C¥LM.C.4906/2016 2

petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued
against him to secure his presence before the court
below. This court in exercise of powers under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be
justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned
Magistrate in granting bail.

4.1t is for the petitioner to approach the learned
Magistrate and appraise the reasons for his absence
and to seek for recalling the warrant and grant of bail.
There is no reason for this Court to assume that the
learned Magistrate will not exercise his discretion
judicially and in accordance with law.

5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender
before the trial court within 2 weeks from the date of
this order and prefer application for recall of warrant

and also for grant of bail with advance notice to the
 201

C¥LM.C.4906/2016 3

prosecutor concerned. In that event the learned
Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the
said application, uninfluenced by the pendency of the
warrant, preferably on the same day itself, on its
merits and in accordance with law.

Petition is disposed off as above.
