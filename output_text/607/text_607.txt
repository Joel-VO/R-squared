Crl.M.C.No.7392 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER

Heard. On a perusal of the complaint and the allegations
against the 2° accused, who is the petitioner herein, it seems
that at the most the complaint is one of breach of contract and
nothing more. It cannot invite an offence under Section 420 IPC
as against the petitioner.

2. Even though, the learned counsel for the 2”
respondent has argued that some documents were forged by the
2" accused, there is no such allegation in the complaint.
Matters being so, all further proceedings in Crime No.1337/2017
of the Hill Palace Police Station as against the petitioner herein
can be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings as against the petitioner in Crime No.1337/2017 of

the Hill Palace Pc

Station are hereby quashed.
