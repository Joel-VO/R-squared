THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON

 220KERDIS

ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2020

Petitioner is the fifth accused in sc
No.739/2014 on the files of the Assistant
Sessions court, Thrissur for having allegedly
committed offences punishable under Sections
143, 147, 148, 324, 506Ci) and 307 read with
section 149 IPC. The case against the
petitioner was split up and re-filed from the
parent case, SC No.60/2002. The petitioner had
earlier appeared and charge was framed against
him. But not being aware of that, the learned
Assistant Sessions Judge directed him to appear
again for framing of charge on 20.8.2019, on
which date, he was absent and his application
for exemption from personal appearance was
rejected. The bail granted to him was cancelled
and NBW was issued on 14.11.2019. The
petitioner was reported to be abroad, consequent

to which it was directed to take steps under
 220KERDIS

Sections 82 and 83 Cr.PC.

2. Report was called for from the
Principal Assistant Sessions Judge and in the
report, it is stated that inadvertently without
noticing that charge was framed, the case was
again posted for framing of charge. The
petitioner is willing to proceed with the trial
of the case. His plea has already been recorded
and therefore there was no embargo in his
appearing through counsel to proceed with the
trial. The case is not posted for trial and
witnesses have not been summoned. Despite that,
his bail was canceled, which apparently is a
mistake on the part of the learned Assistant
Sessions judge.

3. In the result, the orders of the
learned Assistant Sessions judge directing
cancellation of the bail and issuance of NeW and
to take steps under Sections 82 and 83 Cr.PC on
20.8.2019 and 14.11.2019 shall stand quashed
under Section 482 cr.Pc. The petitioner shall

continue in bail on the very same bond and shall
 220KERDIS

appear before the court for trial as and when
called for.

The Criminal M.c. is allowed as above.
