 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V, J

Cri.M.C. No.4492 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of August, 2016

ORDER

1.The petitioner is the accused in L.P.No.40 of 2008 on
the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,
Thiruvananthapuram.

2.0n his failure to appear before the learned Magistrate
in pursuance to summons issued, coercive steps have
been issued against him. The petitioner seeks for
issuance of appropriate directions to the learned
Magistrate to consider his application for recall of
warrant and grant of bail on the date of surrender
itself and to grant him bail.

3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the
petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued

against him to secure his presence before the court
 CHLM.C.4492/2016 2

below. This court in exercise of powers under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be
justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned
Magistrate in granting bail.

4.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned
Magistrate and appraise the reasons for his absence
and to seek for recalling the warrant and grant of bail.
There is no reason for this Court to assume that the
learned Magistrate will not exercise his discretion
judicially and in accordance with law.

5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender
before the trial court within 2 weeks from the date of
this order and prefer application for recall of warrant
and also for grant of bail with advance notice to the
prosecutor concerned. In that event the learned
Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the

said application, uninfluenced by the pendency of the
 caLM.cas922016 3
warrant, preferably on the same day itself, on its
merits and in accordance with law.

Petition is disposed off as above.
