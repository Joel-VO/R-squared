B.KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioners are accused in Crime No.571 of 2017 of the
Bekal Police Station, registered for the offences punishable
under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452 and 427 IPC read with
Section 149 IPC.

2. Itseems that the matter has been amicably settled
between the parties.

3. On going through the facts and circumstances of
the case, it seems that the matter can be permitted to be
settled. It has been reported that no criminal antecedents
have been reported against the petitioners. The defacto
complainant has filed Annexure-All affidavit affirming that the
matter has been amicably settled between him and the
petitioners and he has no complaints against the petitioners.
Considering the fact that the matter has already been settled
amicably between the parties, this court is satisfied that no

purpose would be served in proceeding with the trial of the
 2018KERZI6
(CrLM.C.No.6888 of 2017 2

case. Matters being so, Annexure-Al First Information Report
in Crime No.571 of 2017 of the Bekal Police Station, and all
further proceedings in it, as against the petitioners, are liable
to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-Al
First Information Report in Crime No.571 of 2017 of the Bekal
Police Station, and all further proceedings in it, as against the

petitioners, are hereby quashed.
