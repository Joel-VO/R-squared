SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.20 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2017
ORDER

Petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.1 of

2014 of Palakkad Excise Range for offence punishable under section
55(a) of the Abkari Act.

2, The allegation of the prosecution is that on 01.01.2014,
the car belonging to the petitioner herein was found loaded with
168 liters of spirit and left abandoned. Crime was registered and
matter is now pending as C.P.No.39 of 2016 of Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-III, Palakkad, Petitioner submits that he was not
arrested nor he was aware of the entire proceedings. Having come
to know about the pendency of proceedings, he has approached this
Court stating that he is ready and willing to appear before the court
below and to seek his relief there. ‘The apprehension of the
petitioner is that in the event of his appearance, the court below
may not consider the bail application on the same day, considering
the fact that it is a matter exclusively triable by the Sessions Court.

3. Having regard to these facts, I feel that the petitioner

herein may be permitted to surrender before the jurisdictional
 217KERRI?

magistrate within a period of 10 days from today and seek
appropriate relief. In the event of his filing of an application, court
below shall take up the application on the same day itself, having
regard to the above facts.
CrLM.C. is disposed of as above.
