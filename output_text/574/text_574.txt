ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.P.No.34/2006
in Crime No.302/2015 of Tanur Police Station.on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Parappanangadi

2. The defacto complainant alleged that, on 24/2/2015 at
p.m., the accused trespassed into his house and caused bodily
injuries on him using a knife. It was alleged that he hit on the
chest of the defacto complainant and when he fell down, he hit on.
the back side also. It was submitted that the parties have resolved
their disputes and the second respondent has no objection in
quashing the proceedings.

3. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that
the parties have settled their dispute and the petitioner is not
involved in any other crime,

4, Though the conduct of the petitioner and the allegations
may prima facie appear to be serious of having trespassed into the
house of the defacto complainant and attacked both sides of his
body with knife, it was pointed out by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the only a small knife attached to the nail cutter was

used. This is clear from the final report, which also. states that the
 2017/KER/I803
CHLM.C.No 69642016 2

knife attached to the nail cutter alone was used. Petitioner is not
involved in any other crime, as submitted by the learned Public
Prosecutor.

5. In the light of the above, I am inclined to hold that the
dispute arose on the spur of the moment and there is nothing to
show that the act done by the petitioner herein is a premeditated
‘one. Hence, I am inclined to take lenient view.

In the result, Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings in
C.P.No.34/2016 in Crime No.302/2015 of Tanur Police station, on
the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Parappanangadi stand quashed.
