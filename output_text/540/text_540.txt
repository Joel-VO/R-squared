Cri. M. C. No. 6245 of 2017

Dated this the 7° day of December, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner stands arrayed as the sole accused in Crime
No.955/2017 of Puthoor Police Station, Kollam District for offences
punishable under Sections 354, 354 (A) (i) (ii) (iil) (iv), 506(i) and
509 of IPC. The allegation of the de facto complainant, who is
arrayed as the 2™ respondent herein is that after the marriage of
the 2" respondent with the son of the petitioner herein on
25.08.2013, the petitioner used to sexually harass her. It is
alleged that the petitioner used to make sexual advances towards
her. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was registered and
the investigation is progressing.

2. In the meanwhile, the petitioner has approached this
Court to quash the proceedings on a premise that the dispute
arose from a matrimonial discord between the 2° respondent and
her husband, who jis the son of the petitioner herein. It is
submitted that matrimonial disputes were sorted out and after
realizing that the complaint was laid under the strained

relationship, an affidavit has been filed.

Cri. M, C. No, 6245 of 2017

3. The learned Senior counsel for the 2 respondent and
the the learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to
Annexure IV affidavit affirmed by the 2™ respondent, At
paragraph 4 of the affidavit she has asserted that there were
some dispute between herself and her husband and the father-in-
law, without ascertaining the facts, blindly supported his son. In
such circumstance being frustrated, she was forced to lay a
complaint. It was also stated that the disputes have now been
sorted out between the parties and application for divorce is filed.
Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to a
complaint, which the 2 respondent laid before the SHO of
Puthoor on 20.06.2017. A copy of that complaint which was
obtained by the petitioner herein under the RTI Act was placed
before me at the time of hearing. In the above complaint she has
only referred to physical harassment by the petitioner herein
though there is a vague reference that the father-in-law had
caught hold of her. She has stated that she suppressed it to
maintain the matrimonial relationship. However, Annexure | FIS
indicates more serious allegations which are not seen disclosed in
the complaint,

4. Parties are closely related. It is seen that matrimonial
 2017KERIISS
Cri. M, C. No, 6245 of 2017 3

relationship is between the son of the petitioner and 2”

respondent. Hence there is reasonable chance of 2 respondent

having set up a baseless allegation. This is reiterated by the
complaint dated 20.06.2017, in which the serious allegations are
conspicuously absent. Even the FIS relates to incidents that
happened much earlier. Having considered these facts, the

settlement arrived at between the parties and fact that the

petitioner is a 71 year old man, | am inclined to invoke the

jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to ensure that the cordial
relationship between the parties continue and the dispute being
purely personal, family issue.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime
No.955/2017 of Puthoor Police Station, Kollam District stand

quashed.
