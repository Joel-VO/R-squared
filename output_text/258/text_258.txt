Cri.M.C. No.867 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018

Petitioner is the accused in CC No.627/2015 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam,
based on Annexure-B final report in Crime No.2536/2014 of
Ernakulam Central Police Station for the offence punishable
under Section 135(1)(e) of the Indian Electricity Act
(Amendment) 2003. The allegation against the petitioner is
that he has made use of the electricity obtained by him in a
domestic connection for commercial purpose, thereby
causing wrongful loss of %40,740/- to the Kerala State
Electricity Board.

2. It has come out that the entire amount of

%40,740/- has been paid by the petitioner. The petitioner
 Cr.M.C.867/2016

2018KERRI7

had approached the Kerala State Electricity Appellate

Authority and filed an appeal against the action initiated by

the KSEB against him. By Annexure-C order,

the

proceedings initiated against the petitioner through the final

assessment order dated 06.12.2014, was set aside by the

Appellate Authority. In Annexure-C order, the Appellate

Authority has observed that-

3.

“The action of the appellant would have
fallen under dishonest intention, if a higher tariff
electric connection existed in this premises. No
case of any tampering of meter has been
recorded in the site mahazar. The allegation of
dishonest intention against the appellant has not
been established by the respondent either in the
site mahazar or through any other evidence.
Hence, the action of the appellant is not falling
under the purview of Section 136 of Electricity
Act 2003 (amended in 2007) and the action
taken by the respondent is quite unfair and
unsustainable.”

According to the learned Standing Counsel for
 Cr.M.C.867/2016

the KSEB, Annexure-C proceedings are independent
proceedings and it cannot have any bearing on the criminal
action relating to the offence committed. At the same time,
it seems that through Annexure-C order, the Appellate
Authority has found that no offence has been made out
under Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act. The Appellate
Authority has in categorical terms declared that there was
no dishonest intention on the part of the petitioner in making
use of the said electricity connection for commercial
purpose. When the Appellate Authority of the Kerala State
Electricity Board itself has found that there are no elements
to invite an offence under Section 135 of the Indian
Electricity Act, and especially when the amount assessed
has been paid by the petitioner, the continued prosecution
will not yield any fruitful result. Matters being so, all further
proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Emakulam, which

has arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central
 Cr.M.C.867/2016

Police Station, can be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further

proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Emakulam, which

has arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central
Police Station, are quashed.
