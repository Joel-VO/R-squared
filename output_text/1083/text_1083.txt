 5018
8 Point No. 1 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, points No.1 is considered
together. Prosecution case is that the accused have committed an offence
punishable under section 24 of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior

Citizens Act.

9. Evidence adduced by the prosecution : PW1 Harikumar deposed thatCW1

Soudamini is not acquainted to him, he further denied the statement before the

11,Submissions made _by the learned counsel for the accused persons ; The
learned counsels for the accused nos. 2 to 6 submitted that the accused persons

are innocent and there is no evidence to prove the allegation .
 6or8

12.Submission made by the learned APP ; The learned APP submitted that the

accused persons were neglected to take care of CW1 and the prosecution

evidence is sufficient to prove their guilt

13.Evaluation_of the evidence ; Section 24 of Maintenance and Welfare of
Parents and Senior Citizens Act provides as follows:
Exposure and abandonment of senior citizen. —Whoever, having the care or
protection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the
intention of wholly abandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three

‘months or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both

14. In Pramod John v. State of Kearla, 2024 (4) KHC 557, Honourable Apex
Court observed that It is evident that, “the offence arises when a senior citizen
or a parent is abandoned wholly by a person who is bound to take care of the
senior citizen/parent and it was further observed that the term ‘abandoning’
requires total neglect. The said term when prefixed by the word ‘wholly’
indicates absolute and complete abandonment, The word ‘wholly’ is explained
in P Ramanatha Aiyer's Law Lexicon 4th Edition as “entirely, completely, fully,
totally and in every respect”. Thus unless there is a total and complete

abandonment of the parent by leaving him in a place without any arrangement
 7018
for taking care of the senior citizen, the offence cannot be said to have been
committed. The transportation of a parent between the children could be for
various purposes and even based on an understanding arrived at either

between the children or between the parent and the child”.

15.In order to hold the accused persons liable for the offence w/s. 24 of
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, the prosecution
has to prove that the accused persons who are duty bound to look after CW1
Soudamini Devi Amma willfully neglected to take care of her and abandoned
her. But coming to the present facts, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is not
sufficient t0 prove that CW1 was abandoned by the accused persons.
Moreover,PW1 did not support the case of prosecution. Hence there is no
direct or any circumstantial evidence to show that CW1, Soudamini Devi

‘Amma was abandoned by the accused persons.

16.On considering the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it can be seen that there is
nothing on record to disclose that the accused have committed the offences as
alleged by the prosecution. Having considered the evidence on record, this
court is of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the
accused persons and for the said reasons, point No.1 found against the

prosecution.

‘Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and they are acquitted of the said
