B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER

Originally, the petitioner was the 1* accused in
C.C.No.3/2016 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa, West,
Eleri, for the offences punishable under Sections 447 and
427 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. In fact, all the specific allegations were against
the 2° accused in the case. A2 to Ad faced the trial before
the Grama Nyayalaya and they were acquitted by the
Grama Nyayalaya for want of evidence through Annexure-
A3 judgment.

3. The case against the petitioner is now pending as.
C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa. On going

through Annexure A3 judgment, it seems that even if the trial
 2018KER?260
CRLM.C.No, 8698 of 2017

against the petitioner is proceeded with, no fruitful purpose
would be served and therefore, all further proceedings in
C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa, West,
Eleri, can be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings in C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya,
Parappa, West, Eleri, as against the petitioner, are hereby

quashed.
