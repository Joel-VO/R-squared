Crl.M.C.No.516 of 2016

Dated this the 3 day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 2 and 3 in
Crime No.58/2015 of Shornur Police station for offences
punishable under Section 498(A), (ii) read with Section 34 IPC.

2. The defacto complainant filed a complaint alleging
matrimonial cruelty against her husband arraying him as the
first accused and the petitioners herein as accused Nos. 2 and 3.
On the basis of the complaint lodged, investigation was
completed, the final report was laid and the matter is now
pending as CC No.498/2015 of JFCM Court, Ottapalam.
Cri.M.C.is laid on a premise that Annexure Al compliant does
not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence punishable
under Section 498(A). It was contended by the learned counsel,
relying on page 2 of the complaint, that the second and third
accused were only the neighbours. There was no demand from
them for dowry also. There was no averment that the cruelty was
of such a gravity as to drive the defacto complainant to commit
suicide.

3. In the light of the above contentions, the learned public

CAM.C.NoS162016
prosecutor was directed to ascertain as to whether the
petitioners herein are related to the first accused. After
verification, learned public prosecutor had submitted that the
first petitioner was the uncle of the first accused and the
second petitioner was the wife of the first petitioner. This was
recorded by order dated 24/6/2016. There are averments in
the complaint that the first and the second accused had
assaulted the defacto complainant and threatened to kill her if
she returned to the house. There are other averments
touching upon the cruelty meted out on her.

4. Having regard to the above facts, | am satisfied that
the contentions set up by the petitioners herein will not
survive. Having regard to this, I am inclined to dismiss the
Cri.M.C. reserving the right of the petitioner herein to raise
all the above contentions before the trial court.

With the above observation, the Crl.M.C.is dismissed.
