SUNIL THOMAS, J.
Cri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017
Dated this the 8" day of December, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner herein who is the respondent in M.C.
No.842/2010 of the Family Court, Tirur suffered an order of
maintenance under Sections 125(3) and 128 of Cr.P.C. In
execution proceedings, the petitioner was brought under arrest
and by Annexures A2 and A3 orders, the court below on the date
of his surrender noted that he has committed default and ordered
him to be detained for separate specified periods mentioned in
Annexures A2 and A3. This is assailed in Cri.M.C. No.5435/2016
The petitioner was ordered to be released by the order of this
Court dated 26.08.2016 relying on the decisions reported in
Abdulrahiman v. State of Kerala (2011 (4) KLT 124) and
Mohandas V. Jayanthi (2012 (3) KLT 43) on a premise that
the petitioner was ordered to be detained without compliance of
the statutory formalities,

2. Cri.M.C. No.6969/2017 arises from the order in Crl.M.P.
No.457/2016 in M.C. No.842/2010. In that also, the petitioner was
brought under arrest finding that the petitioner has committed

default of 13 months and he was ordered detention of 15 days for
 2017KERITO

Cri. M, C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017

each months default. This is the subject matter of Crl.M.C.
No.6969/2017. In that, by order dated 11.10.2017, the petitioner
was ordered to be released on the same reason as mentioned in
connected Cri.M.C.

3. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner
is that, the court should have conducted an enquiry as to whether
petitioner herein has committed any default without any reason

TT

was considered by this Court in the above said decisions,
Necessarily, the court is bound to conduct an enquiry into that.

4, The petitioner has a further case that the applications
for execution are barred by limitation, in so far as it relates to the
period beyond one year from the due date. To buttress that
argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the
decisions reported in Abdulrahiman's case and Mohandas’
case as well as Ali.C and others V. State of Kerala and
Others (2013 (4) KHC 871)

5. Having regard to the above two contentions taken up
by the learned counsel for the petitioner, | am inclined to set
aside Annexures A2 and A3 orders in Cri.M.C. No.5435/2016 and

‘Annexure A2 in Cri.M.C. No.6969/2017. The matters are remitted
 2017KERITO

CCrl.M, C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017
3

back to the court below to consider, in the light of the decisions
referred to the above, whether there was default without any
reason from the part of the petitioner herein. The court shall also

consider the question whether the apf ns for execution in

Cri.M.C. No.5435/2016 and in Cri.M.C. No. 6969/2017 are beyond
the prescribed period under the statute. Any other preliminary
objection raised by the petitioner herein shall also be raised by
the court below. The court below shall thereafter proceed in
accordance with law.

Crl.M.Cs. are allowed to the above extent.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
