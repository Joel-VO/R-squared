Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.c.

2. Petitioners were accused 1 and 4 in
C.C.No.189 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Kayamkulam. The accused
allegedly committed the offences under Sections 143,

tried. They were acquitted by Annexure-II judgment.
The petitioners have surrendered and their case is
now pending as C.C.No.436 of 2017. The proceedings
are sought to be quashed in the light of the

and the learned Public Prosecutor.
