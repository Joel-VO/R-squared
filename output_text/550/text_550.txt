No.6428 of 2014
Dated this the 6” day of December, 2017
ORDER

Annexure-A1 complaint in respect of C.C.No.615/2014
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's. Court-II,
Thamarassery, is under challenge. The petitioner is the
accused before the court below, against whom cognizance
has been taken by the court below for the offences
punishable under Sections 342, 352, 323 and 324 IPC and
Section 116(C) of the Kerala Police Act.

2. It is alleged that the complainant was called to the
Police Station under the guise of recording his statement,
and there he was tortured and harassed. Of course, it is a
matter to be proved through evidence.

3. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,
this is a case wherein sanction under Section 197 CrP.c.
ought to have been obtained for taking cognizance of the
offences against the petitioner. The learned counsel for the

petitioner has relied on the decision in Devinder Singh and
 2017KERD301
CAM. No.6428 of 2014

others v. State of Punjab [(2016)12 SCC 87] wherein
specific guidelines have been given by the Apex Court
regarding the cases in which Section 197 CrP.C. has
application. On going through the said guidelines, presently
it cannot be said that this is a case wherein sanction ought to
have been obtained. It has to be established during trial.

4. It is true that as per the decision in Devinder
Singh (supra), question of sanction may arise at any stage
of the proceedings. Normally, such question of sanction has
to be considered at the pre-cognizance stage, and if sanction
is found to be necessary, the courts do not take cognizance
of the offences until order of sanction has been produced.
That is not the end of the matter. Question of sanction can
be raised at the time of framing of charges also, in case it is
found that sanction is required, courts do not frame charges
until sanction is produced. That is also not the end of the
road.

5. Even during trial, the said question can be raised;
but at that stage i.e., after the framing of charges, the

accused cannot seek a discharge on the ground of want of
 2017KERD301
CCHL.C. No.6428 of 2014

sanction. At that stage, the accused can move only for
canvassing an acquittal. In case the court feels that sanction
is required and it has come out through evidence during trial
that sanction is required, the court below can acquit the
accused on the ground of want of sanction after dispensing
with the examination of the remaining witnesses. That is
also possible.

With liberty to the petitioner to have recourse to such
steps, and with liberty to take up the very same contentions
during any such stage as noted above before the court below,
this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
