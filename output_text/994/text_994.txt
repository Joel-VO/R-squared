Order Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are discharged under

Section 245(2) of the CrPC of the offences
under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441 of
the IPC.

This case having come up for consideration before this Court on
07.01.2025, this Court on the same day passes the following:

ORDER

1. This case arose on a Private Complaint filed by the Complainant alleging
‘commission of the offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441 of the
IPC against the Accused persons. The Complaint was taken on file against
Accused Nos, 1 to 4 for the above offences vide Order of this Court dated
25.05.2019.
 2. This case is in the stage of pre-charge enquiry, i.e., posted evidence of
‘Complainant under Section 244 CrPC since 13.10.2020. This Court had posted
this matter twice as last chance for Complainant's evidence on 04.10.2024 and
04.12.2024 respectively. The Complainant was continuously absent thereafter
and twice applied orally on ground of illness. However, they were duly
represented by their respective Counsel. In fact, the Complainant through his
Counsel on 04.12.2025 filed a ‘not press memo’ and finally, the case was posted
for evidence as No Further Time on 04.01.2025.

3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities
to the Complainant to adduce evidence as elucidated above, and it is submitted
that she does not intend to proceed with the case further and not press memo
also filed to that effect. The Accused, though absent, applied and were
represented by their Counsel.

It is well settled that a Complainant seeking to formulate a charge
against accused is bound to adduce evidence in support of his case at the stage
of pre - charge enquiry since evidence already recorded by the Court under
Sections 200 and 202 of CrPC is not admissible in evidence nor binding on the
Accused, Neglect of the complainant to proceed with the enquiry and adduce
evidence must be reckoned by the Magistrate to be a situation where the
complainant lacked necessary materials in support of accusation and therefore
the proposed charge is groundless. (See Rahmath v. State of Kerala and Others,
2020 (4) KHC 90)

From a careful consideration of the records in this case and the conduct
of the Complainant, it appears to this Court that the Complainant does not
intend to proceed with the above matter. This Court is satisfied the Complainant
has neglected to participate in the pre-charge enquiry despite umpteen
‘opportunities granted to her to adduce evidence in support of his case and that
he has failed, for no good reasons in adducing the evidence requisite for
formulating charge against the Accused. This is further fortified by the not
press memo filed by the Complainant. This can only lead to the conclusion that
she lacks materials in support of her accusation and that the proposed charge is,
groundless. In wake of above circumstances, this Court does not find any other
reason to proceed with the matter further, as continuation of the proceeding
any longer, in absence of Complainant at this stage would remain only a futile
exercise and would cause serious prejudice to the Accused. Hence the Accused
 persons are discharged of the aforesaid offences under Section 245(2) of the
crc,

4. Resultantly, the Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are discharged under Section 245(2)
of the CrPC of the above offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441
of the IPC.

(Pronounced in open court on this the 7* day of January, 2025)
