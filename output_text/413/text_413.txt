SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.4560 of 2016

Dated this the 12” day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime
No.297/2013 now pending as CP.No.439/2014 for
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323,
324 & 308 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The allegation of the defacto complainant is
that due to previous enmity, the accused on 22.09.2013
at 11.30 pm, hit the defacto complainant on his head with
a stick. It was alleged that attempts were made to cause
grievous injuries. Alleging the above, crime was
registered and that the case is now pending. The
petitioners contended that the disputes have been settled
between the parties and the defacto complainant has no
further grievance as against the petitioners herein.
Though Section 308 IPC is attributed, in fact no injuries

are caused on the head. Even according to the
 2017KERII797

Cr1.M.C.No.4560 of 2016

Prosecution allegation is that had the hit not been warded
off, the victim would have sustained grievous injuries.
However, the antecedents of the petitioners herein does
not appear to be appreciable. It was submitted by the
learned Public Prosecutor that the first petitioner is
involved in several cases and is included in the rowdy list.
It is further submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor
that the second petitioner was involved in KAPPA
proceedings. However, the learned counsel for the
petitioners submitted that the KAPPA proceedings were
withdrawn by the order of the Government dated
02.06.2015. The copy of the above order indicating that
KAPPA proceedings were withdrawn pursuant to the
opinion of the advisory board, placed on record.
However, having considered the fact that the allegations
against the petitioners herein are serious and that the
petitioners are involved in several other cases, I am not
inclined to hold that the dispute is of a personal nature

and hence can be settled.
 2017KERII797

Cr1.M.C.No.4560 of 2016 3

Crl.M.C is closed reserving the right of the
petitioners herein to move at the trial court at appropriate

stage.
