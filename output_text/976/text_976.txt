This case having been finally heard on 25.01.2025 and this Court on
27.01.2025 pronounced the following:-

JUDGMENT.
1. This is a case instituted upon the final report filed by Sub Inspector of
Police, Karamana Police Station in Crime No. 578/2010 for the offence under
Section 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to
as the IPC’).

2. ‘The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The marriage of the
Informant and the 1" Accused was solemnized on 16.08.2000. Ever since her
residence at the matrimonial home, she has been physically and mentally
harassed in the name of dowry by the Accused persons herein, in
furtherance of their common intention. She was coerced to get from her
‘mother an amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakhs Fifty Thousand Only)
‘and handover the same to the Accused persons. When she refused the
demand for more money, allegations were made against her and pursuant to
hhaving taken possession of her gold ornaments, the Accused persons
deserted her. Under the instigation of the 2" and 3° Accused, the 1*
Accused approached the Court for obtaining divorce and the Informant in
 3

turn, for return of gold and ornaments from them as well as proceeded
against them for having committed domestic violence against her. Through
intervention of relatives, the issues were sorted out and they started residing
together separately in a rented premise. However, the physical, mental and
verbal abuse continued. The 1" Accused got her gold ornaments under the
guise of keeping the same in locker and misapporopriated the same by
selling it off and deposited the same in financial institution, but withdrew the
same. She was coerced to give them an amount of Rupees Four Lakhs only
from her Federal Bank account, which was never returned to her. She was
mentally, verbally and physically abused by the Accused persons for demand
of dowry and the same subsequently led to the death of her parents due to
‘mental agony. The car gifted by her parents was sold off by the Accused
persons and they even attempted to forcefully take away their child. Thus,
‘the Accused persons are thereby alleged to have committed the offence
punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC.

3. On issuance of process, the Accused persons entered appearance.
‘They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their
‘own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to

thom, After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge
‘was framed for offence u/S. 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. It
‘was read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and
‘claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution CWs 9, 10, 5 and 2 were examined as
PW to PW4 respectively and Exhibit P1 to P6 were marked. The Learned
APP gave up the remaining witnesses as the Informant never turned up
before this Court and the material witnesses turned hostile to the
Prosecution and the Prosecution evidence was closed. The Accused persons
were examined under Section 313(1)(b) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
(hereinafter referred to as the CrPC). They denied all the incriminating
‘evidence against them and submitted that they were absolutely innocent of
all the allegations levelled against them,
 4

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following
points arise for consideration.

a. Have the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention
subjected the Informant to cruelty and thereby committed offence
punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?

b. _If'so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

6 Point (a); PW1, is the Investigating Officer in the above case. He
deposed that he had registered Exhibit P1 FIR in this case on the basis of
Exhibit P2 Complaint forwarded from this Court. He had recorded the
statements of the witnesses, visited the place of occurrence and prepared
Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar. He prepared Exhibit P4 Mahazar pertaining to
‘the marriage of the Informant and 1% Accused from the marriage register.
He deposed that the alleged commission of the offences took place during
the period between 18.08.2000 and 19.08.2010.

PW2, deposed that he took over the investigation from PW1, verified
the records, prepared Exhibit P5 Address Report pertaining to the details of
the Accused persons, completed the investigation and filed Charge Sheet
against them,

PWS, the occurrence witness, deposed that she knew the Informant
since her mother was alive and that the Informant and the 1* Accused were
not in terms and had disagreements between them, on account of which the
present case was filed. She deposed that she gave statement to the police
officials about the incident and further that the statement she gave to the
Police that the Informant was harassed on account of demand for dowry is
correct, however the same is only hearsay.

‘The Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the
ingredients of Section 498A of the IPC has not been established by the
Prosecution. The Informant herself has not turned up before this Court. The
only occurrence witness who has been examined herein is not a credible
witness. She has no consistent case. Her testimony cannot be believed.
 5

‘There is nothing on record so as to implicate the Accused persons in the

above case.

It is settled that in order to constitute cruelty, the willful conduct of
‘the husband should be of such a nature that it is likely to drive the woman to
Commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life. There is no
‘case that the complainant attempted to commit suicide or that there was any
grave injury caused posing danger to her life. Under explanation (b)
harassment, so as to amount to cruelty, has to be with a view to coerce the
wife or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any
property or valuable security or on account of failure to meet such demands.
Appreciating the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 together what is evident is that the
allegation that there was demand for more dowry is not supported by any
reliable evidence. As regards the version of assault is concerned, the same is
“unsupported by oral and medical evidence.

As rightly pointed out by the Learned Counsel for the Accused, the
Informant has not turned up before this Court to prove her case. Steps under
Section 82 CrPC already effected against her. Same is the case of CW4,
‘another occurrence witness. The only occurrence witness is PW3. A perusal
of her testimony would reveal that she has no consistent version. On the one
hand she deposes that she has only hearsay knowledge about the alleged
cruely and on the other hand during the cross-examination she deposes to
have witness the quarrel between the Informant and her husband.
Interestingly, when question was put to her as to why the same does not find
a place in the statement given by her to the Police, she would say that she
cannot state something which she doesn’t know. Furthermore, it has come
out in evidence through her cross-examination that she has acquaintance
with the Informant who used to take her to the temple and further that she
‘got acquainted with the mother of the Informant who had travelled with her
in a bus. The most that could be gathered from her version is that there were
some discords between the Informant and the 1* Accused.
 6

In wake of the said circumstances, this Court is not satisfied therefore
that the Prosecution has succeeded in proving the ingredients of S.498 (A) of
the IPC beyond reasonable doubt. This point is therefore answered in favour
of the Accused Persons.

7. Point b: In the light of the finding in Point (a), this Point therefore
does not arise for consideration.

8 Im the result, the Accused 1 to 3 are found not guilty of having
‘committed the offence punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC.
‘They are acquitted u/s. 248(1) of the CrPC of the said offence. Their bail
bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
