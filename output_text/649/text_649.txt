Crl.M.C.No.7964 of 2017

Dated this the 8" day of December, 2017
ORDER

Annexure-Al FIR in Crime No.582/2017 is under

challenge. The crime has been registered for the offences

ions 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substance Act,

2. A huge quantity of explosives were seized in this
case. According to the petitioner, he had legally procured the
said items through Annexures AS and A6. Annexure-AS is
dated 30.01.2017 by which four boxes of ‘super power 90’
and one box of ‘safety fuse’ were purchased by the petitioner.
Through Annexure-A6 the same quantity of materials as is
contained in Annexure-AS were purchased by the petitioner,
on 01.02.2017. Even though these materials were allegedly
purchased on 30" day of January and 1* day of February, the
same were allegedly kept there. The seizure was on
08.09.2017. At present, in the absence of any evidence it
cannot be believed that the materials were allegedly
purchased through Annexures AS and A6. Allegedly, the

materials were not properly kept also.

either sides, it has come out that presently there is
absolutely nothing to interfere in the matter. Let the
investigation go on in the matter.

With liberty to the petitioner to challenge the final

report in case he is aggrieved, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
