‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE
 Ce1.MC.No.5415 OF 2020(F) 2020KERISHT

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.799/2017
registered at the Ernakulam Rural Police Station for
offences punishable under Sections 341, 324, 294(b),
323 and 34 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.20/2018
on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Kolenchery. The de facto complainant, at
whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed
as the 2™ respondent. Annexure-IIl affidavit has
been filed by 2" respondent stating that the dispute,
which was the reason for the incident and
registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably
and he has no subsisting grievance against the
petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,

who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners

have no criminal antecedents.
 cel.Me J oF 2020(F) 22UKERASST

3. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the injury caused
and having perused the affidavit filed by the
2 respondent, the contents of which are
submitted to be true and voluntary, I am
satisfied that the dispute is settled and no
public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement,
possibility of the criminal proceedings ending
in conviction is remote. As such, continuance
of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.
State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and
 202UKERISST

Ce1.MC.No.5415 OF 2020(F)
another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no

impediment in granting the relief sought.
In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in C.C.No.20/2018 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery
is quashed.
