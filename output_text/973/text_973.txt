This case having been finally heard on 02.12.2024 and this Court on
04.12.2024 passed the following:

JUDGMENT.
1. This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of
Police, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 3687/2013 for the offences
punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’).

2. The Prosecution allegations in brief are as follows: The Accused was the
driver of the KSRTC bus bearing registration No. RRC 803. He drove it rashly,
negligently and in a manner so as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause
hurt or injury at about 6.30 pm on 12.06.2013 from Vellayambalam to
Ambalamukku on Vellayambalam -Ambalamukku road, It hit the motorcycle
bearing Registration No. KL 21 D3194 which was driven by the Informant. Due to
its impact, the Informant fell down on the road and sustained serious injury to his
rright knee and left palm causing contusion and swelling. Further he also sustained
fracture in his finger. Thus, the Accused is thereby alleged to have committed the
above stated offences,

3. This Court took cognizance upon the Final Report in respect of offences
under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the IPC, On issuance of process, the Accused
entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of
his own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him.
After preliminary hearing, the particulars of offences under Sections 279, 337, 338
of the IPC were read over and explained to the Accused, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed to be tried.

4, From the side of Prosecution, CWs1 and 3 were examined as PWs 1 and 2
respectively and Exhibit P1 marked. The presence of CWs2, 4, 5 and 11 could not
bbe procured by the Prosecution. Report also filed to the effect that the presence of
CWs 2 and 11 cannot be procured in near future and that CW11 is a cancer
patient, who is laid up. Further steps under Section 82 of the CrPC were effected
against CWs 4 and 5. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP
as the material witnesses had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no
incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the
‘examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed
with, No Defence evidence was adduced,

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points
arise for consideration.

a, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently, in a
manner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby
committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently
in a manner endangering the life and personal safety to PW1, caused hurt to
her and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337 IPC as
alleged?

c. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in the manner
aforesaid caused grievous hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence
punishable under Section 338 of the IPC as alleged?

d. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and to avoid repetition,

PWI deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred on 12.06.138
at Ambalamukku at 6.30 pm, while he was on his way back home to Venkode after

 4

his work. According to him, KSRTC Bus had hit on the backside of his motor cycle
during the display of the green traffic signal. He sustained injury on his left hand
and right knee, He went to Govt. Medical College Hospital for treatment. He
deposed that he gave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police. However, he denied
{identification of the bus, the depo, the reason for the incident and further that he
hhad not seen the person who allegedly drove the vehicle. PW2 also denied having
witnessed the incident and having given statement to that effect.

‘On going through the evidence and the materials on record, itis pertinent to
note that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no
‘case that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused himself. In
fact, PW1 categorically deposed that he had not seen the driver of the KSRTC Bus
that had hot on the back of his motor cycle and has no case that it was the Accused
‘who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the Prosecution so as to implicate him.
PW2, one of the occurrence witnesses also denied having witnessed the incident
and turned hostile to the Prosecution. The presence of CWs2, 4, 5 and 11 could
not be procured by the Prosecution. The remaining witnesses were given up by the
Prosecution as the material witnesses, the injured himself, had turned hostile to
the Prosecution and also no purpose would be served in examining the remaining
witnesses in the said circumstance. Thus, there is nothing on record as revealed
from the deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged
incident that the Accused by the aforesaid acts committed the above offences,
having caused PW1 to sustain injuries. The Prosecution has thus failed to
substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the
guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence these points are found in
favour of the Accused.

7. Roint d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found
in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

8 In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the IPC. Hence, the
 5

Accused is acquitted of the said offence under section 255(1) of CrPC. His bail
bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
