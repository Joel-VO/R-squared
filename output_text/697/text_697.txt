Crl.M.C.No.8508 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER

First petitioner had married the second respondent on
11.09.2015. Thereafter, the matrimonial relationship got spoiled
leading to the laying of a FIS by the second respondent. It was
alleged by her that, she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the
husband and the in-laws. Accordingly, crime was registered as
Crime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police Station for
offences punishable under sections 406, 498A and 34 of the Indian
Penal Code. Annexure-A is the FIS. After completion of
investigation, final report was laid and the matter is now pending as
C.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur.

2. CrLM.C is laid by the accused on a premise that the
dispute with the defacto complainant has been completely settled to
her satisfaction and both parties have decided to get the
matrimonial relationship seperated by due process of law. It is
submitted that joint application for judicial separation was filed
under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act and is pending before
the Family Court, Thrissur.

3. In the light of the settlement between the parties, no

purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein.
 2018KERISO6

Accordingly, Crl.M.C is filed.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel
for the second respondent reiterated the settlement arrived at
between the parties on the strength of Annexure-B affidavit filed by
the second respondent, Having considered the submission of the
learned Public Prosecutor that the matter has been settled between
the parties and reported to the police, I am inclined to hold that, no
purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein.
In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings

arising from Crime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police

Station in C.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,
Thrissur will stand quashed.
