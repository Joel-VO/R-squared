SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.6236 of 2016

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2017
ORDER

Petitioner herein is the accused in Annexure-A2 FIR for

proceeding under section 107 Cr.P.C. The reason stated in
Annexure-A2 FIR is that the petitioner herein indulges in criminal
activities affecting the public order and hence for preventing him
from committing such acts, bail may be taken from him. This is
challenged in this Crl.M.C.

2. Evidently, Section 107Cr.P.C is contemplated as an
independent proceeding by itself. It cannot prima facie be the
subject matter of registering the FIR . Having regard to this, I am
inclined to quash Crime No.691 of 2016 of Sasthamcotta Police
Station, It is made clear that this will not bar the respondents from
initiating independent proceedings under section 107Cr.P.C.

In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
arising from Crime No.691 of 2016 of Sasthamcotta Police Station
stand quashed.
