be served in examining him when the material witnesses themselves had turned
‘against the case of the Prosecution and the Prosecution evidence was closed.

Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CrPC’) was dispensed with, No

‘evidence adduced on behalf of the Accused.

Has the 5% Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of
their common object, used sword in violation of the Arms Act and thereby
committed offence under Section 27 of arms Act,

If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

Points atof: These points are considered together for the sake of brevity

and to avoid repetition.

PWI deposed that he sustained injury in the incident and that he had given

Exhibit P1 statement to the police regarding the incident. He deposed that he is
unable to identify the assailants. He further deposed that he knows the Accused.
To the question put by the Learned APP, he categorically deposed that he doesn’t
 5

intend to proceed the matter further with this Accused and the case with other
has Accused already been settled.

PWs 2 to 4 cited as occurrence witnesses turned hostile to the case of
Prosecution, wherein they deposed not to have witnessed the incident and further
denied having given a statement to the police officials to that effect. PWS, the
Scene Mahazar witness though admitted his signature in the Exhibit P2 Scene
Mahazar denied to have known the contents therein and further that he was not
present at the time when the Mahazar was prepared by the Police officials and
that he doesn’t remember at which place he had signed the same. Similarly, PW6
admitted to have affixed his signature in Exhibit P3 Recovery Mahazar, but
doesn’t know the arm that has been recovered and further that he was not
present at the scene of occurrence and the he did not identify the arm to be a
sword.

‘On careful consideration of the materials placed on record and the
submissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused, it is
crystal clear that there is nothing on record to implicate the involvement of the
Accused in the above crime, The injured himself has no consistent case. At one
point he deposes that he is unable to identify the Accused and later deposes that
he does not intend to proceed with the matter. The injured cannot approbate and
reprobate. Merely for the reason that: he knows the Accused, that does not imply
his involvement especially when PW1 deposed that he is unable to identify his
assailants. The occurrence witnesses also turned hostile to the Prosecution. The
deposition of the Mahazar witnesses renders the recovery and inspection of the
alleged scene of occurrence questionable, which is unexplained by the

Prosecution. The remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as no

purpose would be served in examining him in the above circumstances. Thus, this
Court is of the view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the
involvement of this Accused in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt.
‘Therefore, these points are found in favour of the Accused herein.
 6

7. Roint_h: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are
found in favour of the Prosecution, question of sentencing the Accused does not

8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,149, 323, 324 of the IPC and 27
of Arms Act. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section
248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.

‘The Sword recovered as per Exhibit P3 Mahazar and entered in the
Property Register of this Court as T. No.29/2003 shall be disposed of in
accordance with the rules subject to the period of Appeal, and in the event an
Appeal is preferred, pursuant to its finality thereof,
