Cri.M.C.No.69 of 2024

Dated this the 22” day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C
to quash all proceedings against him.

2. Petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.632/2023 on the files
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery arising out of
Crime No.967/2023 of Kalamassery Police Station, Ernakulam District,
registered for the offences under Sections 294(b), 427 and 392 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 3% respondent is the defacto
complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, the accused by inflicting
bodily harm abused the defacto complainant and destroyed mobile
phones kept in the shop and thereby committed the offences alleged.

4, Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the
petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,
considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be
served by continuing the proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303],
 224KERZ204
GRL.MC NO. 69 OF 2024

3
the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can
take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim
and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This
view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6
SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand
and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653).

7. | have perused Annexure A4 affidavit filed by the 3°
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon
verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the
defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied
that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in
this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for
quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an
exercise in futility,

8 Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in
C.C.No.632/2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Kalamassery, are quashed.

This Cri.M.C is allowed.
