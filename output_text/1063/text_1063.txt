6. If the accused Nos. 1 to 4 are found guilty? What is the order of the

9. Point Nos. 1 to 5 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, points Nos. 1 to 5 are
considered together. Prosecution case is that accused persons have committed

offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 149, 283 and 188 of Indian Penal

Code, 1860.

10. PW1L, Antony Isaac was examined by the prosecution to prove the occurrence
but he denied his statement to the police and deposed that he didn’t witness
any such obstruction of public pathway by the accused persons as alleged by

the prosecution .

11.PW2, Sudheer denied his statement before the police and deposed that he had

not witnessed any such incident as alleged by the prosecution.

12. PW3, Antony Augustine deposed that on 30.4.2016 he was on duty with SHO
and Homeguard and had seen that 50 people under the leadership of Anto Elias
‘marched to Valiyaveli Church road .He further deposed in the examination in
chief that he doesn't know the reason for the march .In the cross examination

hhe deposed that the police party had not received any complaint from the
 60113
general public .To the question that whether they face any difficulty in moving

through the way he answered that they did n’t have.

13, PW4, Rajasekharan Nair was the home guard attached to Poonthura Police
station during the said period .He deposed that on that day he was doing
patrolling duty along with other officers and witnessed that about 50 persons
under the leadership of Anto Elias were marching. According to him the S HO
asked them to march without causing any kind of obstruction to public. He
further deposed that he cannot properly identify whether the persons standing

at the dock were in the march , He was turned hostile to the prosecution case.

14, PWS, Jayasanil.R_ was the SHO of Thumba police station during the alleged
time of incident .He deposed that he along with SCPO Antony Augustin and
Home guard Rajasekharan Nair went on patrolling duty .He further deposed
that on getting the information that about 50 CPIM workers under the
leadership of Anto Elias marching by obstructing the public way in
Valiaveli,they reached their and saw that,they were marching from Valiaveli
‘ground to the north of Valiaveli Church and then back to Valiaveli ground by
causing obstruction to the public way Due to the insufficient number they
couldn't arrest the accused persons .He further identified his signature in Ext

PI report and registered Ext P2 FIR . According to him, the ExtP3 scene was
 70113

prepared on the next day. He identified the accused persons .

15.PW6, Prathapachandran deposed that on 1.5.2016 he was doing patrolling duty
along with PWS, He deposed that the Ext P4 report consists of name and
details of the accused persons , he further identified Ext P2 FIR and Ext P3
scene mahasar .In the cross examination he deposed that police party has not

received any complaint from the general public .

16, Submission made by learned App : The learned APP submitted that the
prosecution has proved guilt of the accused persons and hence they are not

entitled acquittal.

17 Submissions made by learned counsel for the accused persons : The
learned counsel for the accused submitted that though the prosecution alleges
that the march lead by accused no.1 obstructed the public way and caused
disturbance to the general public ,no independent witness could be examined
by the prosecution to prove the guilt of accused .Hence accused persons are

entitled to get acquittal

18, Evaluation of evidence : PW1 and PW2 were the independent witnesses
 80113
produced by the prosecution to prove the scene mahasar and occurrence of the
incident . However they were turned hostile to the prosecution case . The
reason for the march is nowhere stated by the prosecution .PW3 to PWS were
the official witnesses .PW3 in the examination in chief itself deposed that he is
unaware of the reason for the march ,further deposed that even after the
direction of PWS , the SH O the accused persons were not dispersed the march
According to him there was obstruction of public way .Whereas PW4 who
accompanied PW3 and PWS, deposed that the SHO only gave a direction to do
‘march without causing disturbance of public way but he cannot identify the
accused persons .In the cross examination of PW4 he deposed that the police
jeep was following the march and when the march returned back they
accompanied the march .PW6 in the cross examination admitted that there was
no complaint from the general public. Now lets examine whether the
prosecution has proved that the accused persons did the march in violation of
the order promulgated by the public servant and thereby obstructed the public
way .The reason for the march /rally by the accused persons is not proved by
the prosecution . None of the witnesses deposed that the march caused any
obstruction to the public or in any way caused hindrance to the public right of
‘movement .It is the common understanding of an ordinary prudent man that
when a public pathway is obstructed it would affect the public at large .And the
public is the proper source to depose whether they are disturbed by the march

or not There is no such evidence to that effect .Furthermore PW4 ,who
 90013
accompanied the police party itself stated that the police party were following

the march to the north and on the return of the march

19, Now let's examine whether the offence w/s.188 of the Indian Penal Code is
attracted in the facts of the present case or not .S.188 is extracted as follows =
$.188: Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.—

‘Whoever, knowing that, by an order promulgated by a public servant

lawfully empowered to promulgate such order, he is directed to abstain
from a certain act, or to take certain order with certain property in his
possession or under his management, disobeys such direction,

shall, if such disobedience causes or tends to cause obstruction, annoyance

or injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury, to any person

ment for a term

lawfully employed, be punished with simple impris

which may extend to one month or with fine which may extend to two
hundred rupees, or with both;

and if such disobedience causes or trends to cause danger to human life,
health or safety, or causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand

rupees, or with both.

20. In order to take cognizance of the offence w/s.188 of IPC there is an express
 2

10 0113,
bar wis.195 of Code of Criminal Procedure1973 . In Santhosh Kumar v. State
of Kerala (2020 (5) KLT 322) it was held by the Honourable high court of
Kerala that a Court can take cognizance of the offence under S.188 IPC only
on a formal complaint filed by the public servant himself. ‘The present case is
taken on a police report and not on a complaint made by the public servant .In
short the cognizance of $.188 itself is barred. Resultantly 1 am of the view

that accused persons were not committed the offence u/s.188 of IPC.

. As far as the offence w/s.283 is concerned ,the prosecution has to establish that

the accused persons formed an unlawful assembly in order to obstruct the
public way o public line of navigation . Analysing the facts of the case with
the evidence of witnesses nobody except PW3 and PWS stated that public way
is obstructed .Though PW3 and PWS states that there was an obstruction of
public way by the march ,nobody from the general public has the complaint
that there way was obstructed by accused persons . Furthermore there is no oral

evidence to show that it was an unlawful assembly ,since the rem:

ing 46
persons were not identified or listed by the prosecution .In Poulose K.K. v.
State of Kerala (2013 (4) KHC 539) it has been held that mere allegation
that a meeting was organized by a group of persons blocking traffic is not
sufficient, to prosecute persons having unlawfully assembled, the ingredients

thereof has to be satisfied. It is discussed there in that the question to be
 2

B

10813
examined is whether the assembly was unlawful. The unlawful assembly has
been defined under $.141, IPC. One of the five situations covered by that
Section has to be satisfied to hold that the assembly consisting of more than

‘one person was an unlawful assembly.

In Preetha K.K. and others v. State of Kerala and another (2016 (2) KLT
482) it was observed as follows : As far as the offence under $.283 of the IPC
is concerned, there should be some clear and cogent material to disclose that
obstruction was caused to any person in any public way. In none of the
statements and materials, which are accompanying the impugned Annexure -

final report / charge sheet is there even a remote whisper anywhere therein as
to any alleged obstruction caused by anyone of the accused to persons who are
using the public way. Not even a single person so alleged to be obstructed by

any such alleged act of the accused is even arrayed as witness in Annexure - 1

proceedings

Freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and expressions are guaranteed by
the constitution to each individuals. Only when is the act of an accused,
become offensive, then the offence w/s.283 will be attracted .Apart from the
evidence of PW3 and PWS that there was an oral order of the SHO to

terminate the march ,there is absolutely no other evidence that it caused any
 120113

obstruction to the public Hence in the light of above judgments and

considering the acts it cannot be said that the accused were committed offences

ss. 143, 147, 149, 283 and 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Hence these

points are answered against the prosecution .

24, Point No. 6 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 to 5 the accused Nos. 1 to 4 are

found not guilty of offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 149, 283 and

188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said offences

under section 255(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Their bail bond stands

cancelled and they are set at liberty.
