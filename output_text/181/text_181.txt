Cri. M.C No. 208 of 2015

Dated this the 13® day of January, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioners herein are three ‘Juveniles in Conflict with
Law’ facing prosecution with Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam in
C.C No.1/2015, involving the offences under Section 457, 380 IPC.
The first informant on whose complaint the police registered the
crime is one Biju Joseph. The petitioners seek orders under Section
482 Cr.P.C quashing the prosecution against them before the
Juvenile Justice Board on the ground that they have come to terms
amicably with the complainant out of court, and the complainant
Biju Joseph has no grievance or complaint now. The complainant
Biju Joseph is the second respondent herein. He has filed affidavit
to the effect that the has settled the dispute with the petitioners on
the request of their parents, and that the whole dispute stands
resolved forever. He has no grievance or complaint now. I am well
satisfied that the parties have come to terms amicably, and that
orders quashing the prosecution is required in the interest of the
juveniles facing prosecution. 1 find that continuance of proceeding

before the Juvenile Justice Board in the above situation will not

rl. M.C No. 208 of 2015 2

serve any purpose, and if trial proceeds it may cause harm and
hardship to the juveniles.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioners herein before the Juvenile Justice Board,
Ernakulam in C.C No.1/2015 will stand quashed under Section 482
Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from such
proceeding, and the bail bond, if any, executed their

guardians/parents will stand discharged.

P.UBAID,
JUDGE
