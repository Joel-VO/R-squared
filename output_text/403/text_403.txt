Crl.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016

Dated this the 01" day of August, 2016

ORDER xxx

1.The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in C.C No. 283
of 2015 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Malappuram. The aforesaid case has arisen from
Crime No.391 of 2010 of the Malappuram Police Station
registered for offence punishable under Sections 143,
147, 148, 447, 341, 323, 324, 427 read with Section 34
of the Indian Penal Code.

2.After investigation, final report was laid before the
jurisdictional Magistrate and the case was initially taken
for cognizance as C.C. No. 1440 of 2011. The petitioner
is arrayed as the 2 accused in the aforesaid charge.
The case was proceeded with and as per Annexure B
judgment dated 21.02.2015, the accused Nos. 1 and 3

to 7 were found not guilty of the offence and they have
 2016KERI66

CrLM.C.No. 4403 of 2016
2

acquitted under Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

3.The case against the petitioner herein was split up and
refiled as C.C No. 283 of 2015. After the acquittal of
the other accused, the matter was amicably resolved
between the parties and Annexure-C is the affidavit
sworn to by the 2” respondent/de facto complainant
before this Court wherein, he asserts that the matter
has been settled and that he has no objection in
terminating the criminal proceedings.

4.1 have given my anxious considerations to the
submissions made across the bar and I have also gone
through the materials on record. Annexure B judgment,
which records the acquittal of the co accused, reveals
that the de facto complainant had deposed before the
court that the matter had been settled. PWs 2 and 3
are the eye witnesses to the occurrence and they did
not support the prosecution case. Learned Magistrate
came to the conclusion that the evidence let in did not

connect the accused with the crime. These findings
 2016KERI66

CrLM.C.No. 4403 of 2016
3

entered into by the learned Magistrate would definitely
affect the very substratum of the prosecution case. As
held by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Moosa V
Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), though
the reasoning of the judgment contained or appreciation
of evidence in the case of a co-accused therein are not
grounds to attract any relief under Section 482 of the
Code, a case where the substratum of the case is lost is
an exception to the above rule.

5.1 am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be
served by directing the petitioner to face the trial at this
stage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only
purpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious
time during which more productive work can be done by
the court below. The prospects of conviction is
extremely remote owing to the acquittal of the co
accused.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The
proceedings as against the petitioner who is the sole

accused in C.C No. 283 of 2015 on the files of the
 2016KERI66

CrLM.C.No. 4403 of 2016

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram shall

stand quashed.
