Cri. M.C. No. 5344 of 2013
Dated this the 4® day of January, 2018.
ORDER

The petitioners are accused Nos. 3 and 4 in C.C. No. 2347 of
2009 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,
Ernakulam. The offences alleged against the petitioners are under
Section 67 of the Information Technology Act and Section 34 of IPC.

2. The case of the prosecution is that the first accused was
standing in the Vyttila bus stop and playing some obscene pictures in
his mobile and the police arrested him on getting some reliable
information. While questioned, he said that the picture was received
from the mobile shop of the second accused. The petitioners were
seen working in the mobile shop of the second accused and thereafter,
they were implicated as accused Nos. 3 and 4.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that there is
no allegation against the petitioners in the charge and they were
unnecessarily dragged before the Magistrate Court. Hence, they have
filed this Cri. M.C seeking to quash Annexure Al charge in C.C. No.
2347 of 2009 pending before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate
Court, Ernakulam.

4, This Crl. M.C was filed in the year 2013. To a query whether
the case is pending before the trial court, it was reported that this case

was originally filed before the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate,
 2018KERDIT
CrLM.C. No, 5344/2013

Ernakulam and was transferred to Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Maradu on 10.04.2015 and it was re-numbered as C.C. No. 683 of 2015
and the case is now posted to 29.01.2008 for FSL report.

5. Today, when the matter was taken up, the learned counsel for
the petitioners submit that the petitioners want to withdraw the Crl.M.C.,
with liberty to file afresh.

Accordingly, this Cri.M.C is dismissed as withdrawn without

prejudice to the right of the petitioners to move afresh, if so advised.

JUDGE.
