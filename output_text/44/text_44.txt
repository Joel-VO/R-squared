BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.31 of 2024

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.PC to
quash all proceedings against him.

2. Petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 1886/2023 of Thaliparamba
Police Station, Kannur District, registered for the offences under Section
308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Third respondent is the defacto
complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, the accused assaulted the defacto
complainant and thereby committed the offences alleged.

4, Heard the leamed counsel for the petitioner and the learned
counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the matter
has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioner ought
to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of
offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the
proceedings,

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC

303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court
 224KERIAA62

CALM.C.No.32 of 2024

can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim
and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view
was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and
Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State
of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. Ihave perused Annexure-B affidavit filed by the third respondent.

The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it i

understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant
stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter has been
settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no
impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in
Crime No. 1886/2023 of Thaliparamba Police Station, Kannur District, are
quashed.

This Cr.M.C is allowed as above.
