CRL.M.C. No. 7719 of 2015

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner is the 4" accused in Crime No.713 of
2007 of the Kasaragod Police Station, presently pending as
L.PC.No.3 of 2009 in C.PNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, registered for the
offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 506(ii)
and 308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. As the petitioner was not in place, the case
against him was split up and it is presently pending as
L.PC.No.3 of 2009 before the above court. The case
against the other accused was numbered as.
S.C.No.355/2008 before the Additional Sessions Court,

Kasaragod. The case was proceeded with in
 CRLM.C.No. 7719 of 2015

S.C.No.355/2008, which has culminated in the acquittal of
the other accused, through Annexure A2 judgment. On
going through Annexure A2 judgment, it seems that there
was no evidence against the accused and the witnesses did
not support the prosecution case. Even if the prosecution
against the present petitioner is continued, there will not be
any chance for conviction. In such case, there is no
meaning in proceeding with the prosecution case.

3. Moreover, on going through the matter, this Court
is satisfied that there are no ingredients to invite an offence
under Section 308 IPC in the matter. It seems that the
matter has been amicably settled between the parties. The
defacto complainant, who is the 2” respondent and the two
other injured have filed separate affidavits as Annexures —
A3(a) to (c) affirming that the matter has been amicably
settled between them and the petitioner and they have no
complaints against the petitioner. When the matter has

been amicably settled between the parties, no purpose
 CRLM.C.No. 7719 of 2015

would be served in proceeding with the matter any further.
Matters being so, all further proceedings in L.PC.No.3 of
2009 in C.PNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, based on Annexure A-1
Final Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of the Kasaragod
Police Station, can be quashed.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings in L.PC.No.3 of 2009 in C.PNo.102/2008 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, based
on Annexure A-1 Final Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of

the Kasaragod Police Station, are hereby quashed.
