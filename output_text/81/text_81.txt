Crl.M.C.No.73 of 2024

Dated this the 5* day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is indicted as the 9" accused in Crime No.1371 of 2023
of Payyannur Police Station, Kannur, alleging offences punishable
under Sections 406, 420, 120B r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.

2, Prosecution case is that petitioner herein, along with other

accused, had availed a loan from the 3" respondent Company
pursuant to a conspiracy to cause unlawful loss to the complainant
and unlawful gain to the accused, cheated the complainant of a
large amount of money, and thereby committed the offences

alleged.

3. Si mner, submitted

.Sasindran, the learned counsel for the pet
that there is absolutely no allegation against the petitioner so as to
rope him as an accused. However, for reasons unknown to the
petitioner, he has been falsely implicated as an accused in the

crime,

4, Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the
learned Public Prosecutor, I am of the view that the FIR in Crime

No.1371/2023 was registered only on 02.11.2023 and the

investigation is continuing. At this stage, it is not proper for this
Court to interdict the investigation. Time and again, the courts
have held that recourse to Section 482 to quash the FIR must be
resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.

5. In the decision in State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and
‘others (1992) Suppl 1 SCC 335, and Shambhu Kharwar v. State of
Uttar Pradesh AIR 2022 SC 3901, the Supreme Court has held that
the courts cannot enter into the merits of the allegations or trench
upon the power of the investigating agency to investigate into
allegations.

In view of the above, I find no merit in this Cr.M.C., and the

same is dismissed.
