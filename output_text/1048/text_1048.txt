in 2020(5) KHC 35 held that in case the seizure ws.102 of Cr.PC is illegal and the

account freezed lacked direct link with the offence alleged, the legal remedy open to

the aggrieved is to approach the Magistrate concemed w/s.451 or 457 of Cr.PC and

seek to get the account de-freezed. But if the freezing is per say contrary to the

provisions of law the aggrieved person can approach the High Court. In the present
