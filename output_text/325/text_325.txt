CrI.M.C.No. 2585 of 2015

Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015

ORDER

The petitioners are accused Nos. 5 and 10 in Crime No.480 of
2013 of Vidyanagar Police Station, which is now pending as C.P. No.

383/2014 on the file of the Judicial

irst Class Magistrate Court-,
Kasaragod. The offences alleged against the petitioners are
punishable under Sections 143,147,148,324,283 and 308 read with
Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The grievance of the
petitioners is that, the Magistrate Court has already issued non-
bailable warrant against them and if they surrender before the
Magistrate Court there is every likelihood of the applications not
being considered on the very same day. Therefore, the petitioners
seek a direction to consider their bail applications on the day of
surrender itself.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this

Crl.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioners to surrender before
 i

Cri.M.C.No, 2585 of 2015

Magistrate Court is further directed to consider their bail applications
‘on the day of surrender itself, strictly in accordance with law. The
non-bailable warrant already issued against the petitioners shall be
kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks.

The Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.

ANIL K.NARENDRAN,
JUDGE
