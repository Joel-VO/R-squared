CrL.M.C.No.3485 of 2013

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioner who is the accused in crime
No.528/2013 of the Mattanchery police station wants to
quash the proceedings in it. The allegation against him is
that he obtained the consent of the additional second
respondent by making a false representation that he would
marry her and he had sexual intercourse with her and he
has now refused to marry her and has thus committed the
offence under Section 376 IPC.

2. There has been no representation for the
petitioner. Heard the learned counsel for the additional
second respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.

3. The prayer is to quash the FIR. It is submitted
that final report has already been filed

4. The proceedings are sought to be quashed on
different grounds. The first is that no offence is made out.

Though the trial court has already framed the charge it is
 201SKERIOSO

CHLM.C.No.3485 of 2013,

not challenged in this proceedings.

5. It is stated in the petition that the matter has
been settled between the parties. This is opposed by the
second respondent, who is the victim in the case. More
over, the offence is non-compoundable. The court cannot
take notice of the agreement between the parties.

6. Thus, in any view of the matter, this is not a fit
case to favour the petitioner with an order under Section
482 Cr.P.C.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.
