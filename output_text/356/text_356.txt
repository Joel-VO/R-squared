Crl.M.C No. 3318 of 2018

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2020

ORDER
The petitioner is the sole accused in the case C.C No. 901/2015
on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Chittur.

2. The prosecution case is that on 15.02.2015, at about 19:30

hours, the petitioner/accused hit on the face of the de facto
‘complainant with a hammer causing fracture to the bones of his nose
and jaw and thereby the petitioner committed an offence punishable
under Section 326 IPC.

3. The case against the petitioner was registered as Crime No.
196/2015 of Chittur Police Station on the basis of the statement given
to the police by the de facto complainant. After completing the
investigation, final report was filed against the petitioner for an
offence punishable under Section 326 IPC and the learned Magistrate
has taken cognizance of the offence.

4, This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing
the proceedings against the petitioner in the case on the ground that

he is totally innocent.

5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Public Prosecutor and also the first respondent/de facto complainant.

6. The allegations against the petitioner in the chargesheet,
prima facie, disclose the commission of an offence punishable under
Section 326 IPC by him.

7. The witness list filed by the prosecution along with the
chargesheet shows that, apart from the de facto complainant/injured,
seven other eye-witnesses are cited by the prosecution to prove the

alleged incident. Further, there is also medical evidence to be adduced

to prove the injuries sustained by the de facto complainant. The
hammer alleged to have been used by the petitioner for committing
the offence has also been recovered and produced before the trial
court.

8. Whether the hammer recovered by the police is a
dangerous weapon or not, whether the injuries sustained by the de
facto complainant could have been caused by that hammer etc. are
matters of evidence.

9, The plea of the petitioner that it was the de facto
complainant and his relatives who attacked him and that he had acted
only in self defence is also a plea to be raised before the trial court

and to be proved by him before that court.
 CrL.MC.No.3318 OF 2018

10. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that there are no

sufficient grounds to quash the chargesheet filed against the petitioner

‘or the proceedings initiated against him on the basis of the
chargesheet.

Consequently, the petition is dismissed.
