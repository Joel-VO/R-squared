304 A of the IPC. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance. He

of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of
offence under Sections 279 and 304 A of the IPC were read over and explained to
him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs, 1, and 13 were examined as PWs1 and
2respectively and Exhibits P1 to P14 were marked, amongst which Exhibits P9, 10,
and 11 were marked subject to Proof. The presence of CWs 2 to 4 could not be
procured by the Prosecution, despite coercive steps have been taken against
 3

them, Steps under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘CrPC’) was effected against CWs 3 and 4. The remaining
witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material witness turned
hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose
from the depositions of the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under
Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with, No Defence evidence was
adduced.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents, The following points
arise for consideration.

a, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a
manner endangering the life of since deceased, causing injury to him and
thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as
alleged?

b, Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in rash or
negligent manner hit the vehicle of since deceased and caused him to
‘succumb to his injuries, and thereby committed the offence punishable w/S.
304 A of the IPC as alleged?

c. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and to avoid repetition.

PWI deposed that the since deceased is not related to him. He has only
worked with the since deceased and that’s how he got acquaintance with him. her
father and that the incident occurred at 2018. He deposed that he was informed
of the same through phone. He went to the Medical College. Thereafter he went
to police station as informed and gave statement. He admitted his signature in
Exhibit P1 FIS, though he initially denied having given the statement. He also
admitted his signature in Exhibit P2 Thrid Party Kaichit.

PW2, the Investigating Officer deposed that he is acquainted with the
signature and handwriting of CW12, his colleague and identified his signatures in
Exhibit P1 and Exhibit P3 FIR. He deposed that he took over the investigation and
Exhibit P12 is the Inquest Report is prepared by him. He had visited the place of
‘occurrence, inspected the same and prepared Exhibit P7 Scene Mahazar. He
prepared Exhibit P5 and P6 Vehicle Mahazar pertaining to the bus and the cycle
respectively, and its records produced on the basis of the Exhibit P7 notice and
Exhibit P7(a) reply notice. They were released on basis of Exhibits P14 and P2
‘Third Party Kaichits respectively. The vehicle was inspected by the AMVI and
Exhibit P9 Inspection Report is produced before the Court. Exhibit P10 is the
Postmortem Certificate issued by CW11 before this Court. Exhibit P11, Scene
Plan prepared by the Village Officer is also produced by him, The arrest of the
Accused was recorded by him and the Accused was enlarged on Exhibit P8 bail
bond and Exhibit P14 is the report reflecting the details of the Accused. He
deposed that he completed the investigation and submitted the final report and
‘could identify the Accused.

This Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and
considered the submissions of the respective parties. On going through the
evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1 does not have any direct
knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the prosecution failed to
procure the presence of the occurrence witnesses who claimed to have seen the
incident, that is, CWs 2 to 4. The deposition of PWI cannot be admitted in
evidence as the same is only hearsay. The remaining witnesses were given up by
the Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor. There is nothing on record as revealed
{from the deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged
incident that the Accused had driven the bus in a rash and negligent manner,
‘causing the injured to succumb to his injuries. Nothing has been brought out in
evidence to the effect to prove the ingredients of the offences alleged. The
Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and
thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence
Points (a) and (b) are found in favour of the Accused.
 5

9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are
found in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the Accused is
acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands
canceled and he is set at liberty.
