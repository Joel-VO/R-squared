the court below as per Annexure — A order.

2. The petitioner has filed this Crl.M.C. praying for
setting aside or modifying condition Nos.1 to 3 in
Annexure ~ A order.

3. Heard.

4. Annexure — A order contains four conditions,
which are extracted hereunder:-

upon execution of bond for Rs.3,00,000/-
 20191KERI36S

Cr1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018

3
(Rupees three lakhs only) with two solvent
sureties each for the like sum to the
satisfaction of this court. The sureties shall
produce solvency certificates for the said
amount. One of the parents of the petitioner
shall also appear before this court and execute
bail bond.

He shall also deposit a sum of Rs.75,000/-
(Rupees seventy five thousand only) as cash
security simultaneous to the execution of bail
bond.

2. He shall appear before the
Investigating Officer twice on every day at
morning and evening until further orders
immediately after his release from jail.

3. He shall surrender his passport if any
before the court while executing bail bond or
file affidavit in the event he does not hold

passport along with a report of verification in
 20191KERI36S

Cr1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018
4
that regard by the S.I. of Police within whose
territorial limits the petitioner resides.

4. He shall not get involved in any offence

while on bail.”

5. When this matter has been taken up for hearing,
the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
petitioner will be satisfied if condition No.1 is modified.
The court below directed the petitioner to deposit
Rs.75,000/-. The learned Public Prosecutor has no serious
objection in reducing the amount to Rs.50,000/-. The other
condition was that the surety should produce solvency
certificate for the bond amount. Even though the bail was
granted on 15.11.2018, the bail could not be executed as the
sureties of the petitioner were not able to produce the

solvency certificate, submitted by the learned counsel. In
 20191KERI36S

Cr1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018
ss

view of the submission of the learned counsel for the
petitioner, it is directed that instead of producing the
solvency certificate, sureties need to produce only the tax
receipt of their properties. The petitioner shall also deposit
an amount of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only)
before the court below, instead of Rs.75,000/- directed by
the court below, simultaneously at the time of executing the
bond.

6. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner was
found in possession of 36.526 Kgs. of Hashish oil in liquor form in
an Alto Maruti Car on 19.3.2018 at about I a.m., in contravention
of the provisions of the NDPS Act. Considering the nature and
gravity of the allegations, I do not find any reason to interfere

with condition Nos.2 to 4 in Annexure — A order.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands disposed of as
above.
Dated this the 4" day of January 2019.
