Cri. M.C No. 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015

Dated this the 8" day of January, 2015.

ORDER

Two prosecutions brought as case and counter, are sought to be
quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C on the ground of amicable settlement
made by the parties out of court. Crime No.998/2011 was registered in
the Vadakkencherry police Station under Sections 341, 323, 324 IPC, on
the complaint of one Kalidasan. The said case is now pending as C.C
No.57/2012 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. The
Petitioner in CrlMC 10/2015 is the accused in the said case, and the
first respondent therein is the said Kalidasan who made complaint. As a
counter case Crime No.999/2011 was also registered under Section 324
of IPC on the complaint of one Unnikrishnan who also sustained injuries
in the incident. The said crime is now pending as C.C No.558/2012
before the same court. The de facto complainant in C.C No.57/2012 is
the accused in the said case, and he is the petitioner in Cri.M.C
101/2015. Unnikrishnan who sustained injuries on the other side is the
first respondent in Cri.M.C 101/2015. Now the parties have come to
terms amicably, and nobody wants to continue the prosecution.

Unnikrishnan and Kalidasan have filed affidavit to the effect that the
 201SKERZ89

rl. M.C No, 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015, 2

whole dispute stands settled and resolved, and that they have
no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied that there
is a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and
continuance of prosecution in such a situation will do harm and
hardship to both the parties. In a situation of amicable
settlement nobody will support the prosecution, if the cases go
to trial. Thus continuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste

of time.

In the result, both the petitions are allowed. The
prosecution against the petitioner in Crl.M.C 10/2015 in C.C
No. 57/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Alathur, and also the prosecution against the petitioner in
Cr.M.C 101/2015 in C.C No.558/2012 of the same
court, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from
prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will
stand discharged.
