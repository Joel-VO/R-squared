K.ABRAHAM MATHEW J.

Cri.M.C, No. 1236, 1243 & 1571 of 2018

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2019

ORDER

In C.C. No.203 of 2012 Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Thiruvananthapuram ordered issuance of summons to the

petitioners under Section 204 Cr.P.C. which is

challenged in these
petitions. The criminal law was set in motion by the second
respondent, who filed Annexure-I complaint before the learned
Magistrate alleging commission of the offences under Sections
86(1) and 86(2) of the Kerala Prisons And Correctional Services
(Management) Act, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act!)

‘Cri.M.C. No.1236 of 2018.

2. Petitioner is the first accused. In one case the Supreme

Court convicted him, who is a former

inister, of an offence

under the Prevention of Corruption Act and sentenced him to
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

undergo imprisonment for a certain term. He was lodged in
Central Prison, Poojappura (Thiruvananthapuram). From there
he was shifted to a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram for
treatment of certain illness on 5.8.2011. It is stated in the
complaint that on 29.11.2011 at the hospital a reporter of a
television channel called him on his mobile phone; the second
accused handed over the mobile phone to him, who talked to the
reporter on the phone; the jail authorities received complaints in
connection with this incident; they took action against the
petitioner only for the offence under Section 81 of the Act though
the facts reveal commission of the offences under Sections 86(1)

and 86(2) of the Act also.

The learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate took
cognizance of the offences mentioned in the complaint and
conducted enquiry and issued process to 204 persons though
there are only two named accused in the complaint, the first of
whom being the petitioner. In this Cri.M.C. the order taking
cognizance is challenged on the following grounds: (i) only the
jail authorities can initiate proceedings against the petitioner (ii)
the petitioner did not use mobile phone as alleged in the

complaint, and (iii) the facts of the case do not constitute any
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

offence.

4, Heard the learned Senior Counsel and others for the
petitioners, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. By the impugned order the learned Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate has found that there are sufficient grounds to
proceed against the 204 accused including the petitioner for the
offences under Sections 86(1) and 86(2) of the Act.

6. Sub-section 3 of section 86 of the Act provides that the
offences under sub-sections 1 and 2 are cognizable. The Act
does not provide that cognizance of the said offences can be
taken only on the complaint of prison officers. The first ground

urged in the Crl.M.C. is devoid of merit.

Another ground on the basis of which the impugned
order is sought to be set aside is that the allegation in the
complaint that the petitioner used mobile phone to talk to a
media reporter is not true. The truth of this allegation, which is
‘a question of fact, cannot be decided in this proceedings.

8. The only ground which deserves notice of the court is
that the facts of the case do not reveal commission of the
offence under sub-section 1 or sub-section 2 of Section 86 of the

Act.
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

Section 86 of the Act runs as follows:

}. Punishment in certain cases.- (1) Whoever, in
contravention of any provisions of the Act, brings or
removes or attempts by any means whatever to bring or
remove, into oF from any prison, or supplies or attempts
to supply to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison,
any prohibited article, and any officer or member of staff
of @ prison who, contrary to any rule, knowingly suffers
any such article to be brought into or removed from any
prison, to be possessed by any prisoner, or to be supplied
to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, and
whoever, contrary to any rule, communicates or attempts
to communicate with any prisoner, and whoever abets
any offence made punishable by this section, shall, on
Conviction before @ Magistrate, be lable to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to fine not
exceeding ten thousand rupees or with both.

(2) Whoever, being a prisoner or a visitor, or a
prison official, is found in possession of an electronic
communication or other equipment inside the prison
against the provisions of the Act or rules, or found to be
manipulating, damaging or destroying any equipment,
electronic or otherwise, in the prison, shall on conviction,
before a Magistrate, be liable to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding two years or fine not exceeding ten
thousand rupees or with both.

(3) The offences mentioned in sub-sections (1) and
(2) above, shall be cognizable and non-bailable.”

10. Section 2(xxxiti) of the Act defines prison: “Prison
means any jail or place used permanently or temporarily under
the general or special order of the Government for the detention
of prisoners and includes all lands and buildings appurtenant
thereto”. (The rest of the definition being not relevant is

omitted).
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

11, It is not disputed before me that the hospital where
the petitioner had been lodged was a prison for the purpose of
the Act because of the special order passed by the Government.

12, Section 86(1) becomes applicable in three situations,
(1) When, a person, in contravention of any provisions of the
Act, brings or removes, or attempts by any means whatever to
bring or remove, into or from any prison, or supplies or attempts
to supply to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, any
prohibited article. (2) When any officer or member of staff of a
prison who, contrary to any rule, knowingly suffers any
prohibited article to be brought into or removed from any prison,
to be possessed by any prisoner, or to be supplied to any
prisoner outside the limits of a prison and (3) When a person
contrary to any rule communicates or attempts to communicate
with any prisoner.

13, There is no allegation in the complaint that it was the
petitioner who brought the mobile phone allegedly used by him
in the premises of the hospital where the occurrence allegedly
took place. So the first situation is not attracted. The second
situation arises only if the offender is an officer or member of

staff of a prison. Obviously, this is not applicable to the
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

petitioner because he is neither an officer nor member of staff of
a prison, The third situation also has not arisen in this case
because it is applicable only when the offender is a person other
than a prisoner, The facts of the case thus do not attract Section
86(1) of the Act.

14, The only question that requires consideration now is
whether the facts alleged in the compliant constitute the offence
under sub-section (2) of Section 86 of the Act. This sub-section
has two limbs. The first limb makes possession of an electronic
communication or other equipment inside the prison against the
provisions of the Act or Rules. The offender may be a prisoner
or visitor or prison official. The second limb is concerned with
manipulating, damaging or destroying any equipment electronic
or otherwise in the prison. There is no allegation that the
petitioner has done any of these acts. So the second limb is not
attracted.

15, The first limb of sub-section (2) of Section 86 is
attracted only if the petitioner was found in possession of an
electronic communication or other equipment. The specific
allegation against him is that he talked to a TV channel reporter

‘on a mobile phone which was handed over to him by the second
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

accused. The subscriber of the phone was the petitioner, the
number being 9447155555. It is the definite case of the second
respondent/complainant that the mobile phone was in the
possession of the second accused. He only allowed the
petitioner to use it when a call came on the phone from a
reporter of a TV channel. Possession is a relationship between a

person and a thing. It shall pass the test of control. Using a

mobile phone is different from possessing a mobile phone. The
facts alleged in the complaint are not sufficient to hold that the
petitioner was in possession of the mobile phone.

16. I have perused the sworn statement of the second
respondent/complainant. His sworn statement is perfunctory in
nature. Admittedly, he has no direct knowledge about the
possession of the mobile phone by the petitioner during the
relevant period. What is mentioned in the sworn statement is
that the second respondent/complainant saw in the media the
petitioner talking to a news reporter on a mobile phone. This is
no reason to hold that the latter was in possession of the mobile
phone at the relevant time. The sworn statement of the second
respondent further discloses that in a letter sent by the

Additional Director General of Prisons there is a mention that
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

complaint had been received that the petitioner used mobile
phone unauthorisedly in prison. This is not sufficient to hold that
the petitioner was in possession of a mobile phone. The other
relevant statement in the sworn statement is that the second
respondent learnt that the petitioner had called others and
others called him during his imprisonment. This also does not
lead to the conclusion that the petitioner was in possession of a
mobile phone.

17. Even if it is assumed that the petitioner used the
mobile phone, it cannot be held that he was in its possession.
Thus, one of the essential elements to attract the offence under
Section 86(2) of the Act is missing in this case. The learned
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate went wrong in taking
cognizance of the offence under Section 86(2) of the Act and
issuing process to the petitioner.

Cri.M.C, Nos.1571 & 1243 of 2018

18. Petitioners in Cri.M.C, No.1571 of 2018 are accused 85
and 98, and the petitioner in Cri.M.C. No.1243 of 2018 is
accused No.92 in C.C. No.203 of 2012 on the file of the
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram.

19. The complaint of the second respondent shows that
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

there are several accused in the case. But only the names of 1*
and 2" accused are disclosed. The other accused are shown as
persons whose involvement will be revealed in the enquiry which
may be conducted by the court under Section 202 CrP.C. The
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate after recording the sworn
statement of the second respondent, sent for the details of the
calls made from and calls made to the mobile phone
No.9447155555, whose subscriber is the first accused (petitioner
in Cri.M.C. No.1236/2018).

20. The impugned order does not disclose why the
petitioners in these Cri.M.Cs are made accused. The
endorsement made in the proceedings sheet by the learned
Magistrate on 6.3.2012, which is the date of the impugned order,
runs thus: “Incorporate the name and address of the persons
shown in the memo into the cause title of the complaint.” (sic)
This does not make any sense. What can be gathered from the
records of the lower court is that the call details of the mobile
phone of the first accused collected from the telephone company
revealed that there were several incoming and outgoing calls
during the relevant period.

21. For the sole reason that neither the complaint nor the
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

impugned order shows the reason for arraigning the petitioners
as accused, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.

22. Anyone could have made a call to the phone, the
subscriber of which was the first accused even though the first
accused was not in physical possession of the mobile phone. So
also any person other than the first accused could have made a
call from the said mobile phone during the imprisonment of the
first accused. There is no material to show that it was they who
made the calls during the imprisonment of the first accused.
Even if it is assumed that the first accused called the petitioners
on his mobile phone during the relevant period, the petitioners
cannot be said to have committed any offence.

23. For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the
learned Magistrate was not at all justified in issuing process to
the petitioners.

24, This case reminds me of the saying that a little
knowledge is more dangerous than little knowledge. The learned
Magistrate should have dismissed the complaint in limine. The
tendency to rush to the court with a complaint by persons who
do not have any material with them to support the allegation

should be nipped in the bud. Unfortunately, the learned
 2n19KERRA

CMC. 123618 & Conn, Cases

Magistrate was more loyal than the king.

In the result, these Crl.M.Cs are allowed. The proceedings
in C.C, No.203 of 2012 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed so far as the

petitioners are concerned
