ORDER
Dated this the Sth day of January 2021

Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime No, 434
of 2018 of Varapuzha Police Station registered for the
offences punishable under Sections 448, 354 and 294(b) of

Indian Penal Code.

+ It is submitted by the learned counsel for
the petitioner that the parties have resolved their entire
disputes among themselves and as such there is no
subsisting dispute between them. Therefore, this petition
to quash the Annexure Ai final report in Crime No.434 of
2018 of Varapuzha Police Station and all further
proceedings in C.C. No. 330 of 2018 of Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur.

4. Learned counsel appearing for the 2"
respondent/defacto complainant has submitted that she has
absolutely no grievance or complaints against the
petitioner. Annexure A2 is the affidavit sworn to by her
in support of the submission of the petitioner. The
affidavit further indicates that she has no intention to
pursue the matter further.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor has reported that
 crt.m.c. 5592/2020 20217KERA36

a
the prosecution has no serious objection in allowing the
petition. It is also submitted that as the dispute has
been amicably settled, the possibility of conviction is
remote and bleak and therefore, no useful purpose would
be served in proceeding with the case.

6. On hearing the submissions of all concerned,
on perusal of the records as well on consideration of the
special facts and circumstances involved in this case, I
find that no fruitful purpose is likely to be served by
proceeding with the matter against this petitioner.
Moreover, no public interest is involved in the case and
there is no legal impediment in granting the prayer as
sought for by the petitioner. Therefore, for the purpose of
securing the ends of justice, this Crl.M.c. is only to be
allowed.

For the foregoing reasons, Annexure Al final
report in Crime No.434 of 2018 of Varapuzha Police station
and all further proceedings in C.C. No. 330 of 2018 of
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur
will stand quashed as prayed for.
