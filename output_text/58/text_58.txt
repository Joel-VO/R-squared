THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 2024KERO12
CRL.MC NO. 44 OF 2024 2

ORDER

This Crl.M.C is at the instance of the accused persons in CC
No.58/2018 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Paravoor,
Kollam, for quashing Annexure A2 final report, which is pending
as CC No. 58/2018 on the file of that court.

2. The grievance of the petitioners is that, though trial in CC
No.58/2018 has begun and non bailable warrant has been issued
against the witnesses, in fact no offence is made out against
the petitioners, going by the prosecution allegations. Moreover,
3 petitioner is a 73 year old lady, and she finds it difficult to
appear before court. Obviously, the trial in CC No.58/2018 has
commenced, and non bailable warrant has been issued against
the witnesses to procure their presence for examination. At this
stage, there Is no question of quashing the final report, on the
ground that, the essential ingredients are not made out to

constitute the offence, which can only be brought out through

the evidence of the witnesses. To prove or disprove the facts

alleged evidence is required, for which examination of witnesses

scheduled. So this Court could not find any merit in this
 2024KERO12
CRL.MC NO. 44 OF 2024 a

petition, and hence it is liable to be dismissed. Meanwhile, the
trial court is directed to expedite the trial in CC No.58/2018, and
to dispose it of, at the earliest, at any rate, within a period of
four months from today. If the petitioners 2 and 3 make
appropriate application for exemption from appearance due to
their old age or ill-health, learned magistrate has to consider it
favourably.

Accordingly, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.

Registry to forward a copy of this order to the trial court

forthwith.
