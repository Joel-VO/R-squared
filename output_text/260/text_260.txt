Cri.M.C. No. 918 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER
The petitioner is the accused in L.P. No. 62 of 2008
on the files of the court below. The above case arose out of
Annexure-A1 complaint filed by the 2" respondent before
the court below against the petitioner alleging offence
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

(“the N.LAct” for short).

2. The petitioner has filed this Cri. M.C. praying
for quashing Annexure-Al complaint and further

proceedings in the above case.

3. Service is complete. However, there is no
appearance for the 2 respondent. Heard the learned

counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public
 2018KER2IS

CFLM.C. No. 918 of 2016

Prosecutor.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has
submitted that eventhough the matter was settled between
the parties, the 2" respondent did not incline to withdraw
Annexure-Al complaint and in the said circumstances, the
petitioner is constrained to approach this Court with the
above Cri, M.C. Annexure-A2 would show that the matter
has been settled between the parties. The petitioner
produced before this Court the original cheque No. 551366
dated 3-10-2005 for Rs. 2,50,000/-, which is the cheque
referred to in Annexure-Al complaint. Since the petitioner
has produced the original cheque before this Court, that
itself would indicate that no successful prosecution against
the petitioner pursuant to Annexure-A1 complaint can be
sustained. Therefore, no purpose will be served even if
the prosecution against the petitioner is permitted to be
continued. For the said reason, I am inclined to quash

Annexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against
 2018KER2IS

CFLM.C. No. 918 of 2016

the petitioner in L.P. No. 62 of 2008 in C.C. No. 1071 of
2005 on the files of the court below in exercise of the
inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P-C., to meet the ends
of justice. It is ordered accordingly.

In the result, this Cri. M.C. stands allowed.
