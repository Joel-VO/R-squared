ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (‘the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the

proceedings pending against the petitioner.

2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.759 of
2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station registered under Sections 452,

323, 324, 354, 427, 506(li) r/w Section 34 of the IPC.

3. On 31.10.2018 at about 1.35 p.m., the petitioners herein
in furtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained the

respondents 2 and 3 and attacked them with weapons causing

inj

4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, the party respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor.
It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have
been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavits filed by
the 2 and 3° respondents to buttress their submissions. It is urged

that the

lispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect

public peace or tranquility.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statements of respondents 2 and 3 have been recorded and

they stated in clear terms that they have no subsisting grievance.

6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced.

7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]

and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],

the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High
Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between
the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal

proceedings.

The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said

to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental
depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will
have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of
proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and

secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the

prosecution would be not!

1g, but a waste of time as the prospects

of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant

4
circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be
well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482

of the Code to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A1 FIR
in Crime No. 759 of 2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station and all

proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
