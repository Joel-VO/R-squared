‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 7002 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2017
ORDER

The husband, who is the 1* accused in CC No.564/2011 of
Additional Chief Judicial Court, Thiruvananthapuram, charged with
offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 324, 506(ii), 34
IPC has filed this Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

2. Petitioner married the complainant on 07.05.2006.
The petitioner was employed in Military Service. Matrimonial
discord led to the lodging of the complaint alleging matrimonial

cruelty against the husband and i

Jaws. Her allegation was that
she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty both physically and
mentally on various occasions. The contention of the husband is
that, he was always away from home except when he came on
leave. There could not have been any harassment during the
limited days of leave. The allegations in the complaint are
inherently improbable. Hence, he sought to quash the
proceedings.

3. The complaint and the statement of the wife show that,
after two months of marriage, husband left to his work place in

Jammu Kashmir, She became pregnant and during that period

Cri. M, C. No, 7002 of 2016

she was subjected to cruelty by in-laws. After delivery, the
husband came down, but he behaved very cruelly towards her.
When she was thrown out from the house, husband supported the
in-laws. She has stated another instance when she was subjected
to physical cruelty by the petitioner, along with other accused.

4, It is clear that even though, husband was away, his
direct and indirect role is narrated by the complainant. In the
above circumstance, it cannot be said that no allegation is made
‘out. Hence, | am not inclined to invoke Section 482 Cr.P.C.

Crl.M.C. fails and is dismissed.
