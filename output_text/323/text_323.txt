“CriM.C.No.2549 of 2015

‘This petition is filed by the petitioner, who is the accused in
LPC.No.186/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg for issuing a direction under
section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner was
arrayed as the accused in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu
police station registered on the basis of a private complaint
filed by the defacto complainant, the wife of the petitioner,
alleging an offence under section 498 A of the Indian Penal
Code, which was forwarded to the police for investigation and
after investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on
file as C.C.No.288/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg. Earlier the petitioner was
arrested, produced and released on bail. But when the case
was posted for evidence, he could not appear and so the case
was transferred to register of long pending cases as

LPC.No.186/2011 and non bailable warrant is pending against
 201SKERA7R23

CH.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 2
him. Since non bailable warrant is pending against him, he
apprehends that even if he surrenders, his bail application will
not be considered and he will be remanded to custody. So the
petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this Court
seeking the following relief:
“Ontthese and other grounds to be urged at the time of
hearing itis most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may
be pleased to direct the learned Judicial First Class Magistrates
Court, Hosdurg to consider the bail application being fled
by the petitioner in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu police
station, Kasaragod district which is now pending as
L.P.C.No.186/2011 on the files of the learned Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Courtll, Hosdurg for enlarge the petitioner
on bail in the above case on the date of his surrender itself, on

such conditions as deems fit and proper in the circumstance of

the case, so as to secure the ends of justice.”

3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Public Prosecutor.

4, Considering the nature of relief claimed in this petition,
this Court felt that the petition can be disposed of today
itself.

CHLM.C.No.2549 of 2015 3

5. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that though he
is prepared to surrender, in view of the pendency of non bailable
warrant, he is likely to be remanded and his bail application
will not be considered, unless a direction is given by this
Court.

6. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor.

7. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was the sole
accused in C.C.No.288/2009 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg and he was granted bail earlier
and subsequently since he is absconding, the case was
transferred to register of long pending cases and it is now
pending as LPC.No.186/2011 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg and non bailable warrant is
pending against him. The apprehension of the petitioner that,
if he surrenders before the court, he will be remanded to
custody without any basis and this Court has in several matters
of this nature observed that there is a duty cast on the
presiding officer of the criminal court to consider and dispose
of the bail application on the date of filing of the application
itself as far as possible and so there is no necessity to issue

any direction as such as claimed in the petition. However,
 201SKERA7R23

CH.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 4
considering the apprehension raised in the petition, this Court
feels that the petition can be disposed of as follows:

If the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg in LPC.No.186/2011
(C.C.No,288/2009 in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu police
station of Kasaragod district) pending before that court and
moves for recalling the warrant and releasing him on bail,
then the learned Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose
of the application on the date of filing of the application itself
after hearing the Assistant Public Prosecutor of that court as
far as possible on the same day itself in accordance with law.

With the observations and directions, this petition is
disposed of.

Office is directed to communicate a copy of this order to

the concerned court immediately.

K. RAMAKRISHNAN, JUDGE.
