ORDER

Petitioners are accused in C.C.No.1131 of 2021 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kottarakkara alleging offences
under Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. According to the prosecution, the accused had, after promising
to supply plywood, collected a cheque issued on the Federal Bank bearing
No.10189269 for an amount of Rs.6,00,000/- and after encashing the
said cheque failed to supply the plywood and thereby committed the
offences alleged against them.

3. SriLatheesh Sebastian, the learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the allegations against the petitioners do not make out
any offence and that a civil suit is pending between the parties as
0.S.No.340 of 2021 on the files of the Munsiff Court, Kottarakkara
wherein the complainant has sought for recovery of money. According to
the petitioner, a pure commercial transaction is attempted to be
converted into a criminal case for the purpose of compelling the
petitioners to yield to the illegal demands of the defacto complainant.

4. [have heard Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor as well.

5. A perusal of the final report reveals that the cheque issued by the

complainant was allegedly encashed by the first petitioner after promising

to supply plywood and thereafter failed to supply the same. Even though
a civil suit is pending between the parties as 0.S.No.340 of 2021, from
the nature of allegations, it cannot be prima facie said that it is a pure

civil dispute. There can be instances when a

dispute will also have
the trappings of a criminal case. However, those are all matters for
appreciation of evidence after due trial

6. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that as
far as the 2” petitioner is concerned, there is absolutely no whisper or
any material to connect him with the crime. If no materials have been
collected by the Investigation to implicate the 2” petitioner, certainly it is
a matter which can be appreciated through a discharge petition as well.

Therefore, reserving the liberty of the 2 petitioner to invoke the
jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate itself, in accordance with law, this

CrLM.C.is dismissed.
