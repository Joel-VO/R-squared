SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.7934 of 2017

Dated this the 8" day of December, 2017
ORDER

Petitioner is arrayed as the sole accused in S.C.No.42 of

2017 of Sessions Court, Alappuzha arising from Crime No.1108 of
2011 of Kayamkulam Police Station for offences punishable under
sections 447, 323 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The genesis of the above crime is attributed to an
incident that happened on 27.09.2011. It was alleged that, on that
day, at about 7 p.m., petitioner allegedly trespassed into the house
of the de facto complainant and assaulted the de facto complainant
and another person, Crime was registered and after investigation,
final report was laid.

3. Petitioner has approached this Court contending that the
disputes have now been amicably settled. The second respondent
has filed an affidavit as Annexure-A2 and the third respondent, who
is the victim, has filed Annexure-A3 affidavit affirming the
settlement. It is asserted by the deponent that the complaint was
given on a mistaken impression and under compelling
circumstances. It is further stated that the parties have now
amicably settled the subject matter of the case and that, they have

no existing grievance against the petitioners. Hence, they sought
 2017KERIIT7S

for quashing the proceedings.
4, Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statement of the de facto complainant was recorded, who
has conveyed about the settlement. There is nothing on record to
show that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime. It
appears that the conduct of the petitioner herein has been condoned
by the victims. Having considered the mutual settlement now
arrived at between the parties, I feel that, no purpose will be served
by prosecuting the petitioners herein. Hence, it is a fit case in which
the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked.
In the result, Cri.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
in S.C.No.42 of 2017 of Sessions Court, Alappuzha arising from
Crime No.1108 of 2011 of Kayamkulam Police Station will stand

quashed.
