Cri.M.C. No.174 of 2024

Dated this the 10" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner challenges Annexure-Al order issued by the
Judicial First Class Magistrate-ll, Pathanamthitta directing
transfer of S.T. No.2061 of 2019 to the Judicial First Class
Magistrate-IIl, Pathanamthitta, pursuant to the order of the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta withdrawing the case and
making it over to the judicial First Class Magistrate-tIl,

Pathanamthitta.

2. Smt. Vijayakumari_R, the learned counsel for the
petitioner, vehemently contended that, S.T. Nos.2061 of 2019
and 2062 of 2019 are proceedings under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instrument Act (for short ‘ the N.I.Act ’) and arose out
of the same cause of action, and in view of the judgment in
Yogesh Upadhyay and Another v. Atlanta Ltd (AIR 2023
SCC 1151) the cases are to be tried together and therefore,

transfer of one case by itself is prejudicial to the contentions of
 2024KER/2902
CRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024

the accused. It is further submitted that, if the trial of one case
alone is carried out, there could be possibility of contradictory
findings, and therefore, it is only appropriate that both cases are
tried together and unless Annexure-Al order is set aside and
S.T. No.2061 of 2019 is retained on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate-II, Pathanamthitta, petitioner could be put to

prejudice.

3. | have heard the arguments of Sri. Noushad K.A.,

learned Public Prosecutor as well.

4, In the decision in Yogesh Upadhyay’s case supra,
the Supreme Court had observed that, since the six complaint
cases pertain to the same transactions, it would be advisable to
have a common adjudication to obviate the possibility of
contradictory findings being rendered in connection therewith by
different courts. The word used by the Supreme Court in the

aforesaid judgment is " advisable and not mandatory *.

5. On a perusal of the impugned order it is revealed
that, the same was issued on 28.03.2023 and the petitioner was
directed to appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-IIl,

Pathanamthitta, on 19.04.2023. In all probabilities, the petitioner
 2024KER2902
CRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024

would have appeared before the said court without any
objection. After acquiescing into Annexure-Al order and
participating in the proceedings for the last 8 months, it is not
proper to now turn around, on the eve of the trial of the case, to

challenge the said order of transfer.

Considering the above circumstances and the delay in
challenging Annexure-Al order, | am of the view that, this is not
a fit case to interfere under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. Accordingly,

this Criminal Miscellaneous case is dismissed.
