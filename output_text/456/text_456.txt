THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION OW
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 CzL.MC.Wo.8064 OF 2020(c! a2. 2onumERIDI2

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime
No.2026/2020 registered at the Mangalapuram Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections 143,
147, 148, 341, 294(b), 324, 326 and 427 r/w 149 of
IPC, The de facto complainant and the other persons
injured are arrayed as respondents 2 and 3.
Annexures-A2 and A3 affidavits have been filed by
the said respondents stating that the dispute, which
was the reason for the incident and registration of
the crime, has been resolved amicably and they have
no subsisting grievance against the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners
have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences

alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
 CzL.MC.Wo.8064 OF 2020(c! 23. 2onumERIDI2

perused the affidavits filed by respondents 2 and 3,
the contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled
and no public interest is involved in this matter, Even
though there is allegation of the petitioners having
committed offence under Section 326 and the records
show that the de facto complainant had sustained
grievous injuries, considering the fact that an
amicable settlement has been arrived at between the
parties, based on which, the de facto complainant,
who is arrayed the accused in Crime No.2055/2020 of
the Mangalapuram Police Station for the offences
punishable under Sections 447, 341, 294(b), 323, 324
and 354 r/w 34 of IPC, had approached this Court by
filing Criminal M.C.No.5058/2020, which was allowed
by order dated 27.11.2020, I am inclined to grant the
relief sought. Moreover, in view of the settlement,

possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in
 CzL.MC.Wo.8064 OF 2020(c! whee 2onumERIDI2

conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of
court and hence, in view of the legal position set out
by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan
Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and
Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another
{(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in
granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure-
Al FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.2026/2020
registered at the Mangalapuram Police Station, as

against the petitioners, is quashed.
