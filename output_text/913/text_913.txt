 This case having been finally heard on today the court on the same day delivered

the following :-

JUDGMENT
This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura

Police Station in crime No. 314/2016 alleging commission of offences w/s
294(b), 324, 427 viw 34 of IPC. Cognizance is not taken for the offence

punishable w/s 294(b) of IPC.

2. ‘The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to political rivalry

towards CW1 and in furtherance of their common intention, on 26/03/2016 at
10.30 pm, on the side of the public road from Kundamankadavu towards
‘Thirumala, shouted obscene words at CW1 and hit on his back with a granite

stone which was a dangerous weapon. The 1" accused also committed

mischief by damaging the headlight and side glass of CW1's Activa Scooter
thereby causing a loss of %.1500/- to CWI. Thereafter, when CWI came to

ident, both the

the party office at Valiyavila and complained about the i
accused abused him with obscene words and the 2" accused hit CW1 with a
‘wooden reaper thereby causing injury on his left arm and shoulder. The

accused thereby committed the offences as alleged against them.

3. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 appeared on summons and they were furnished with

copies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the
offences w/s 324, 427 rw 34 of IPC was framed and it was read over and

explained to them and they pleaded not guilty.

4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 as PW1 and marked a

document as ExtP1. Since the witnesses examined did not support the

prosecution, CW2 to CW7 were given up by the learned APP. Hence, the
 3
prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating
circumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination ws 313
‘of CrP. was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.

5. Heard both the sides.

6. The points that arise for consideration are:~

1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable ws 324,
427 tlw 34 of IPC, as alleged?
2. What shall be the sentence or order?

7. Boint No.1 z= The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 1 witness
and 1 document from the side of the prosecution, PW1 is the sole injured in
this case, He deposed that while he was the Youth Congress General Secretary
at Vattiyoorkkavu, there was an incident in connection with the writings by
the rival Party on the wall booked by them. He affirmed the occurrence and

admitted his signature in ExtP1 FI Statement given to police. However, he

categorically deposed that he could not identify the assailants. The names of

the accused were stated to police upon hearsay. PW1 also deposed that the
matters were settled and he had no further grievances. CW2 who is the brother
‘of PW1 is reportedly laid up. Thus, the sole injured in the case turned hostile
to prosecution, Therefore, the leamed Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the
remaining witnesses. From the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the
‘occurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the
prosecution failed to prove that the accused commited the offences ws 324,
427 t/w 34 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution.

8. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2

 4
are found not guilty of the offences punishable ws 324, 427 r/w 34 of IPC,

they are acquitted ws 248(1) of CPC and set at liberty, cancelling their bail

bonds.

Property produced in this case as T 236/2016 Item Nos. 1 and 2 stone and
\woorlen reaper, being valueless, shall be destroyed.

Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected

and pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28° day of February 2025.
