CrI.M.C. No.4680 of 2016

Dated this the 4° day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in
C.C.No.122/2016 on the files of the court below. The
above case arose out of a private complaint filed by the
second respondent herein before the court below alleging
the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act (in short, ‘the N.L.Act’)

2. The petitioners have filed this Crl.M.C., praying

for quashing Annexure-Al complaint and further

proceedings against the petitioner in the above said case.

3. Heard.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioners has
submitted that the petitioners are not the present
President and Secretary of V.8. Garden Flat Owners
Association and hence, the complaint filed against the
petitioners is not maintainable.

5. It is clearly stated in Annexure-Al complaint
 2018KERD
CrLM.C. No.4680 of 2016

that the liability, which resulted in issuing the cheque in
question, arose out of the supply of the drinking water to
the flat, namely, ‘M/s.V.B.Garden’. The water was
supplied as per the request of V.B.Garden Flat Owners

Association.

6. The provision contained in Section 141 of the
Negotiable instruments Act clearly stipulates that when a
company commits an offence, then certain categories of
persons in-charge as well as the company would be
deemed to be liable for the offence under Section 138 of
the N.I.Act. Thus, the statutory intendment is absolutely
plain. As is perceptible, the provision makes the
functionaries and companies to be liable and that is by
deeming fiction. Therefore, if the company commits an
offence, the company has to be made as an accused. In
explanation to Section 141 of the N.I. Act, “company”
means any body corporate and includes a firm or other
association of individuals. Therefore, without the

association being made as an accused, the complaint
 2018KERD
CrLM.C. No.4680 of 2016

cannot be maintainable.

7. The 1* and the 2 accused are the present
President and the Secretary of V.8.Garden Flat Owners
Association, who represent the association. Therefore,
the petitioners are not arraigned as accused in their
personal capacity. It is also contended in the complaint
that the 3” and the 4" accused were the former President
and Secretary of V.B.Garden Flat Owners Association,
who executed and issued the cheque in question as they
were then in-charge and responsible for the affairs of the
Association. It is further alleged that the 1* and the 2°
accused are presently in-charge and responsible for the
day-to-day affairs of the Association. It is stated that the
3° and the 4" accused, in their capacity as the then
President and Secretary of the Association, issued the
cheque in question. In view of the above averments, | am
of the view that the complaint filed is perfectly
maintainable. However, whether the petitioners are the

present President and the Secretary of the Association or
 2018KERD
CrLM.C. No.4680 of 2016

not, can be decided only after taking evidence. Suffice it
to say that, having gone through the averments in
Annexure-Al complaint, | am_ satisfied that Ext.Al

complaint prima facie discloses the ingredients to

constitute the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. In
the said circumstances, | am not inclined to quash
Annexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against
the petitioners as sought for.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. stands dismissed

However, the petitioners shall be granted exemption
from personal appearance before the court below on all
posting dates except when their presence is necessary for
the progress of the case, if the petitioners file application

in this regard before the court below, after their

appearance in person before the court, within 30 days

from today,
