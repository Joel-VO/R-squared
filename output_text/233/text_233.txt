Cri.M.C.No.481 of 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is aggrieved by Conditions No.2 and 3 imposed in the
order dated 26.12.2023 while granting him statutory bail in Cri.M.C
No.1830/2023 by the Sessions Court, Thrissur. The following two
conditions were imposed in the said order:

2. One of the sureties shail be 2 nearest relative of the
accused and the above fact shall be certified by the village Officer
concerned.

3. Both sureties shall produce their original documents to
substantiate their solvency along with a self attested copy of the said
document.

2. The insistence on one of the sureties being a nearest relative

and that both sureties shall produce the original documents to

substantiate their solvency,

is according to the petitioner impossible of
performance, since he has no near relative in Kerala who is solvent and
further that the available sureties are not willing to produce their original
documents fearing coercive action against them. Petitioner's parents

had migrated from outside Kerala and have allegedly not acquired any

property till date. Therefore, the sureties are not able to produce
solvency certificate also. It was however submitted that petitioner is
willing to produce other sureties who are ready to ensure the presence
of the accused during trial.

3. The condition of one of the sureties being a parent or near
relative who is solvent with landed property owned by him can be in
certain circumstances, an onerous condition, especially when the
accused belongs to another State. Such onerous conditions rendering an
‘order granting bail practically illusory ought not to be imposed,
Reference to the decision in Moti Ram and others v. State of
Madhya Pradesh [1978 (4) SCC 47] is relevant in this regard.

4. The requirement to produce original documents to
substantiate solvency, is also, according to me, beyond the scope of
conditions that should be imposed while granting bail. Though the
conditions provide that original documents can be returned after
verification, still, such a condition can instill fear in the mind of the
sureties. The requirement is only that the sureties ought to be solvent.
Condition that the original document must be produced, can, in fact,
render the order practically incapable of performance, since many a
times the sureties may have mortgaged the property or may be afraid
to produce the original title deeds before the court of law. Such a
condition has in the present case rendered the order granting bail

redundant. In the peculiar circumstances of the present case, especially

 224KERAG7S

4
since the petitioner is from outside the State the conditions insisting on
2 parent or nearest relative having landed property and to produce the
original document are required to be modified.

5. Therefore, | set aside Condition No.2 and 3. inx
Cr.M.C.1830/2023 on the files of the Sessions Court, Thrissur.

This Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.
