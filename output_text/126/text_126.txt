CRL.MC NO. 113 OF 2024

BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

CrLM.C. No.113 of 2024

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2024

ORDER
Petitioner challenges Annexure-A4 FIR registered in Crime

'No.988/2023.

2. According to the petitioner, the registration of the crime
as Annexure-A¢ amounts to double jeopardy since Crime
No.91/2022 has already been registered before the

Pantheerankavu Police Station.

3. On a perusal of Annexure A4 FIR as well as the FIR in
Crime No.91/2022, I am of the prima facie view that both
crimes arise out of different causes of action and therefore the
concept of double jeopardy cannot apply. Even otherwise, the

concept has no application at the stage of investigation as well,

4, Apart from the above, since Annexure-A4 FIR was
registered on 05-09-2023 and the investigation has only
commenced, it is not be proper on the part of this Court to

trench upon the investigating powers of the Police.

5. Therefore, reserving the liberty of the petitioner to
initiate appropriate proceedings in accordance with law after the

final report is filed, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.
