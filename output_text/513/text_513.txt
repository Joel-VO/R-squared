ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime
No.618/2019 registered at the Vadakkekara Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections 143,
323, 324 and 341 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as
C.C.No.1432/2020 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur. The de
facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was
registered, is arrayed as the 2™ respondent.
Annexure-II affidavit has been filed by 2™ respondent
stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the
incident and registration of the crime, has been
resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance

against the petitioners.
 Czl_.MC.Wo.$799 OF 2020(D) whee aozumeneso

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners
have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavit filed by the 2” respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
no public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote.
‘As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount
to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of
the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme
Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab
{(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of

Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is
 Czl_.MC.Wo.$799 OF 2020(D) ao aozumeneso

no impediment in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in C.C.No.1432/2020 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, North

Paravur is quashed.
