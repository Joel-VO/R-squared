ORDER

The vehicles belonging to the petitioners have been seized in
connection with Crime No.474 of 2020 registered at the Kolathur Police
Station for the offences under Section 9B(1)(b) of the Explosives Act.
Seizure was effected on the allegation that the vehicles were parked outside
a quarry, where explosives were allegedly used without valid license.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that there is no

provision under the Explosives Act which enable the police to seize the
vehicles for alleged violation of those provisions. Learned Public Prosecutor
submits, on instructions, that the seizure has been reported to the
jurisdictional Magistrate Court, viz, the JFCM, Perinthalmanna,

3, The seizure having been reported to the jurisdictional Court, the
petitioners can move that court seeking release of their vehicles. If such
applications are filed, learned Magistrate shall consider those applications
and release the vehicles, in view of the indisputable position that Section
'98(1)(b) of the Explosives Act does not empower the police to effect seizure
of vehicles. sd/-
