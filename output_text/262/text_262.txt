Crl.M.C.No.1023 of 2012

Dated this the 1" day of January, 2014.

ORDER
Heard the leamed counsel for the petitioner. Attention of
this court was drawn to Annexure V affidavit, whereby the defacto
complainant solemnly affirmed and stated that the matter has been

settled between the defacto complainant and the petitioner/accused.

It is also mentioned in the affidavit that since they are neighbours
they decided to settle the matter and live in peace. Considering the
submissions and the averments in the affidavit, I find that the
petition is to be allowed to meet the ends of justice. Therefore, the
petition is allowed. The entire proceedings against the petitioner
registered as per Annexure I, II and IV are hereby quashed.

All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed,

JUDGE.
