‘CRL.M.C.No. 5029 of 2020

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2020
ORDER

Petitioner is the 2 accused in Crime No.217 of 2018 of Thrissur
West Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under
Section 22(b)(ii)B of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance
Act. The crime was registered pursuant to the seizure of 2.60
Kilograms of dried ganja from the 1" accused. On questioning, the first
accused stated that the petitioner was his accomplice and had
escaped on seeing the Police. The petitioner was arrested on
12.11.2018 and granted bail subject to certain conditions, including
the condition that the petitioner should not indulge in any other
offence while on bail. Later, the prosecution sought cancellation of the
bail alleging that the petitioner had violated the bail condition by
getting involved in three crimes. According to the prosecution, Crime
No.1122 of 2018 was registered against the petitioner and four others
at the Kunnamkulam Police Station on 3.12.2018 for offences
punishable under Section 143, 147, 148, 341, 308, 506 read with 149
IPC, Thereafter, Crime No.954 of 2019 was registered on 27.9.2019 for
offences under Sections 447, 2948, 506 and 427 of IPC. Again, Crime

No.997 of 2019 was registered on 12.12.2019 for the offences
 crLMcs029/2020 3 2UKERTA

punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 294B and 506 of IPC. The
petitioner opposed the application and produced some medical records
to prove that, on all three occasions, he was admitted in hospitals,
either on the date of occurrence of the alleged crime or on the
subsequent days. It was contended that the petitioner was actually the
victim and not the aggressor. The learned Sessions Judge repelled the
objection and held that, irrespective of whether the petitioner suffered
injuries in the incidents or not, the fact of the matter is that he had
violated the bail condition by getting

wolved in the crimes. Based on

the said finding, bail granted to the petitioner was cancelled as per
Annexure-Al order dated 7.3.2020.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated the

contentions urged before the Sessions Court, of the pet

ioner being
the victim in the three crimes and having been deliberately made an
accused in order to make it appear that he had violated the bail
condition. Relying on certain medical records, attempt was made to
contend that, petitioner was not the aggressor and had been falsely
implicated in the crimes.

3. As rightly held by the learned Sessions Judge, the Court need

be concemed only about the petitioner's involvement in offences while
he was on bail. This fact is amply established by registration of the
crimes against him and it is impossible to believe that three different

crimes were registered against the petitioner to make it appear that he
 crLMcs029/2020 4 2UKERTA

had violated the bail condition. Hence, | find no reason to interfere with
Annexure Al order.

In the result, the Crl.M.C is dismissed.
