THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5574 OF 2020 2020KERIBSS

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 6 in
Crime No.135/2017 registered at the Hosdurg
Police Station, Kasargode for offences
punishable under Sections 341, 323, 109,
120B read with Section 34 of IPC, now
pending as C.C.No.159/2018 on the files of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I,
Hosdurg. The de facto complainant, at whose
instance the crime was registered, is
arrayed as the 2“ respondent. Annexure-AIII
affidavit has been filed by 2™ respondent
stating that the dispute, which was the
reason for the incident and registration of
the crime, has been resolved amicably and he
has no subsisting grievance against the

petitioners.
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5574 OF 2020 2020KERIBSS

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor
also, who, on instructions, submits that the
petitioners have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the injury
caused and having perused the affidavit
filed by the 2 respondent, the contents of
which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute
is settled and no public interest is
involved in this matter. Moreover, in view
of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is
remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State
of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582) and Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab and another ((2012) 10
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5574 OF 2020 2020KERIBSS
5

SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting
the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed.
The proceedings in C.C.No.159/2018 on the
files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate- I, Hosdurg is quashed.
