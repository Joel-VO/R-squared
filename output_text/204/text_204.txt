CRL.MC NO. 268 OF 2024

BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

CrI.M.C. No.268 of 2024

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners challenge Annexure-A2 FIR in Crime No.453 of
2023 of Pathanamthitta Police Station. The offences alleged
against the petitioners are under Sections 420 and 506 read

with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

2. According to the prosecution, the accused had
promised to provide employment at Poland and collected an
amount of Rs.21,00,000/- and thereafter, failed to provide the
employment or return the amount and thereby, the accused

committed the offences alleged.

3. Sri, George Mathew Karamayil, the learned counsel for
the petitioners contended that, the entire prosecution
allegations are false and the petitioners are totally innocent. It
is also submitted that, the real culprit behind the alleged
offence is the defacto complainant himself and that, the

ners have no involvement in this crime.

4. 1 have heard Sri. Aashi M.C., learned Public
 224KERZ2896
CRL.MC NO. 268 OF 2024

Prosecutor as well

5. The crime is only at the investigation stage and it is
too premature a stage to consider the merits of the allegations.
| am of the view that, the case does not fall within the
exceptional circumstances contemplated in the decision in
State of Hariyana & Others v. Bhajanlal & Others (1992
Suppl. (1) SCC 335) to invoke the inherent jurisdiction under

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR itself.

Therefore, | find no merit in this Criminal M.C.,and it is

dismissed.
