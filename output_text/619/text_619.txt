SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.7585 of 2016

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2017
ORDER

Petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.467 of

2012 of Majeshwar Police Station for offences punishable under
sections 143, 147, 341, 323 and 506(i) r/w 149 of Indian Penal
Code.

2. Prosecution alleged that on 23.08.2012 at 7.30p.m.,
accused formed into an unlawful assembly and wrongfully
restrained the de facto complainant and assaulted him. Complaint
was laid by the de facto complainant and after investigation, final
report was laid. Matter is now pending as C.C.No.213 of 2013 of
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Kasaragod.

3. Petitioners approached this Court contending that the
disputes between the parties have been voluntarily settled. An
affidavit has been filed by the de facto complainant as Annexure-A2
touching upon the settlement arrived at. It is asserted in the
affidavit that the de facto complainant does not propose to pursue
the matter in the light of the settlement arrived at between the

parties. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that
 20171KERIS?

the parties are not involved in any other crime and that, they have
voluntarily settled the dispute. In the light of above, I am inclined
to allow the parties to give a quietus to the entire dispute.

In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
arising from Crime No.467 of 2012 of Majeshwar Police Station
stand quashed,
