Cri.M.C.No.6 of 2024

Dated this the 18" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash all proceedings against them.

2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.P. No.14/2017 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-!, Nedumangad, arising out
of Crime —_No.1684/2016 of Venjaramoodu Police _ station,
Thirwvananthapuram, registered for the offences under Sections 341,
294(b), 323, 324 and 308 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
Second Respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, the accused had, assaulted the
defacto complainant and attacked him with an iron rod and thereby
committed the offences alleged.

4. Heard the leamed counsel for the petitioners and the learned
counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter
has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought
to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of

offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the
 224KERI60
CALM.C.NoS of 2024

proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC
303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court
can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim
and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view
was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and
Another ((2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State
of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. | have perused Annexure-A3 affidavit filed by the second
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon
verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto
complainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter
has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no
impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in
CP. No.14/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-|,
Nedumangad, are quashed.

This Cr.M.C is allowed as above.
