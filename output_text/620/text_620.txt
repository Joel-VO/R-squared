ORDER

A snake by name 'Erix johni', which belongs to the family
‘boidae' and which is classified as a wild animal under Schedule
1V of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (hereinafter referred to
as 'the Act") was seized by the Forest Range Officer, Anchal. A
case was registered as O.R.No.3/2019 of the Ezhamkulam Forest
Station in the matter. The snake was seized, while four persons,
two men and two women, were engaged in the trading of the
snake in a house. The aforesaid four persons, who are accused 1
to 4, were arrested from the spot by the Forest Range Officer.

2, The interrogation of the accused revealed that the
snake was kept and transported in the cars bearing Reg.Nos.KL-

16L 2831 and KL-16K 5122. The Forest Range Officer also seized
 2020/K E130

the aforesaid cars.

3. The third accused filed an application under Section
451 CrP.C before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II (Forest
Offences), Punalur for releasing the car bearing Reg.No.KL-16K
5122 to his interim custody. The first accused filed an application
under Section 451 Cr.P.C before the same court for releasing the
car KL-16L 2831 to her interim custody. Both the aforesaid
applications were allowed by the learned Magistrate on the
condition that they shall execute a bond for Rs.5,00,000/- and
Rs.3,00,000/- respectively and also on the condition that they
shall not alienate or dispose of the vehicle or make any alteration
to it and they shall produce the vehicle as and when directed by
the court. The State has filed these petitions under Section 482
CrP.C challenging the orders passed by the learned Magistrate
granting interim custody of the aforesaid vehicles to the aforesaid
persons

4, Heard learned Special Public Prosecutor (Forest) and
also the learned counsel for the respondent in the two petitions.

5. Learned Special Pul

Prosecutor contended that,
 2020/K E130

though the Magistrate has got ample power under Section 451

CrP.C to release the vehicles to the i

terim custody of proper
persons, the Magistrate has to exercise his discretion properly.
Learned Special Public Prosecutor would contend that the
vehicles seized under the provisions of the Act cannot be
released in a casual and mechanical manner. Learned Special
Public Prosecutor further contended that the learned Magistrate
has passed the orders releasing the cars to the interim custody of
the accused in the case without properly considering the
objections raised by the Forest Range Officer.

6. Per contra, learned counsel who appeared for the
respondent in the two petitions, contended that the learned
Magistrate has exercised the discretion in the proper manner
especially in view of the directions given by the Apex Court in the
decision in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujarat :
AIR 2003 SC 638 and this Court may not interfere with the
orders passed by the learned Magistrate,

7. Section 39(1)(d) of the Act provides that every

vehicle, vessel, weapon, trap or tool used for committing an
 2020/K E130

offence and has been seized under the provisions of the Act shall
be the property of the State Government. It is further provided
that when an animal is hunted in a sanctuary or National Park,
any vehicle, vessel, weapon, trap or tool used in such hunting
shall be the property of the Central Government.

8. Section 50(1)(c) of the Act states that, an authorised
officer or any forest officer, who has reasonable grounds for
believing that any person has committed an offence against the
Act, has the power to seize any trap, tool, vehicle, vessel or
weapon used for committing such offence under the Act. Section
50(4) of the Act provides that, any person detained, or things
seized under such power shall forthwith be taken before the
Magistrate to be dealt with according to law.

9. In State of U.P v. Lalloo Singh : (2007) 7 SCC
334, the Supreme Court has considered the scope of the
provisions contained in Sections 39 and 50 of the Act and it has
been held as follows:

"Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 39
deals with a situation when any vehicle, vessel,
weapon, trap or tool has been used for committing
 2020KERIL30
crt mcntoe. 7589/2019 .
an offence and has been seized under the
provisions of the Act. The twin conditions are that
the vehicle etc. must have been used for
committing an offence and has been seized. Mere
seizure of the property without any material to
show that the same has been used for committing
an offence does not make the seized property, the
property of the Government, At this juncture, it is
also to be noted that under sub-section (1) of
Section 50 action can be taken if the concerned
official has reasonable grounds for believing that
any person has committed an offence under the
‘Act. In other words, there has to be a reasonable
ground for belief that an offence has been
committed. When any person is detained or things
seized are taken before the magistrate, he has the
power to deal with the same “in accordance with
law.”
The Supreme Court has further held as follows:
“There is a significant addition in sub-section
(4) by Act 16 of 2003 i.e. requirement of
intimation to the Chief Wild Life Warden or the
officer authorized in this regard as to the action to
be taken by the Magistrate when the seized
property is taken before a Magistrate. A combined
reading of the omitted sub-section (2) and the
substituted sub-section (3A) of the Section 50
 cri.M.c.€os. 7889/2019

‘makes the position clear that prior to the omission,
the officials under the Act had the power to direct
release of the seized article. Under sub-section
(1), the power for giving temporary custody
subject to the condition that the same shall be
produced if and when required by the magistrate is
indicative of the fact that the Magistrate can pass
appropriate orders in respect of the purported
seized property which is taken before him. While
dealing with an application for temporary release
of custody, there cannot be a complete
adjudication of the issues involved as the same is a
‘matter for trial.”
(emphasis supplied).

The Supreme Court had proceeded to hold as follows:

“While dealing with the application the
Magistrate has to take into account the statutory
‘mandate that the seized property becomes the
property of the State Government when the same
has been used for commission of an offence under
the Act and has been seized.

It appears that insertion in sub-section (4)
relating to the intimation to the Chief Wild Life
officer or the officer authorized by him is intended
to give concerned official an opportunity of placing
relevant materials on record before the Magistrate

2020/K E130
 2020/K E130

cri.M.c.€os. 7889/2019

passes any order relating to release or custody. In
appropriate_cases_on consideration of materials
placed before him, prayer for such release or
custody can be rejected.

It Is to be noted that under sub-section (1)
of Section 50 for the purpose of entry, seizure,
arrest and detention the official has to form the
belief on reasonable grounds that the person has
committed an offence under the Act. The
‘Magistrate is, therefore, required to consider these
aspects while dealing with the application as noted
above, It cannot be a routine exercise,”

(emphasis supplied).

10. In State of M.P v. Madhukar Rao : (2008) 14 SCC
624 also, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the scope
of Sections 39 and 50 of the Act. It has been held by the Apex
Court that the Magistrate has power under Section 451 Cr.P.C to
make an order for interim release of the vehicle.

11, In the instant cases, in the order passed by the
learned Magistrate releasing the car KL-16K 5122 to the interim
custody of the third accused, it is stated that the vehicle was
seized from the aforesaid accused and he is a person who had

purchased the vehicle from the registered owner and that the
 2020/K E130

registered owner had no objection to release the vehicle to the
third accused and also that further keeping the vehicle in the
custody of the court would cause deterioration of its value.
Learned Magistrate released the vehicle to the interim custody of
the third accused for the aforesaid reasons.

12. In the order passed by the learned Magistrate
releasing the vehicle KL-16L 2831 to the interim custody of the
first accused, it is stated that the first accused is the registered
‘owner of the vehicle and that further keeping the vehicle in the
custody of the court will only cause deterioration of its value.
Learned Magistrate released the vehicle to the interim custody of
the first accused for the aforesaid reasons.

13. The Forest Range Officer concerned had filed objection
to both applications raising various grounds. I find force in the
contention of the learned Special Public Prosecutor that the
learned Magistrate did not consider any of the objections raised
by the Forest Range Officer against the releasing of the vehicles
to the interim custody of the accused. The learned Magistrate

has granted interim custody of the vehicles to the accused only
 2020/K E130

for the reason that further keeping of the vehicles in the custody
of the court will cause deterioration to the value of the vehicles.
Of course, it is certainly one of the factors to be taken into
account while granting interim custody of a vehicle. It is the
spirit of the decision of the Supreme Court in Sunderbhai
(supra). But, while dealing with applications filed under Section
451 CrPC for releasing the vehicles, which have been seized
under the special statutes like Wild Life Protection Act, Forest Act
etc., the Magistrates have also to take into consideration other

factors also as indicated by the Supreme Court in Lalloo

gh
(supra). They have to consider and dispose of such applications

not

a routine manner but after taking into consideration the
objections raised by the investigating officer or the Forest Officer
or the Wild Life Protection Officer concerned. In the instant
cases, the learned Magistrate has passed orders releasing the
vehicles to the interim custody of the accused in a routine

manner without taking

to consideration any of the objections
raised by the Forest Range Officer.

14. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that it is only
 2020/K E130

proper to remit the applications filed under Section 451 Cr.P.C by
the respondent/accused in the two petitions for fresh
consideration by the learned Magistrate in the light of the

decision of the Supreme Court in Lalloo Singh (supra).

15. Consequently, the petitions are allowed. The orders
passed by the learned Magistrate granting interim custody of the
vehicles to the accused, which are impugned in these Cri.M.Cs,
are set aside. The applications, Crl.M.P.Nos.6932/2019 and
6893/2019 filed in O.R.No.3/2019 of the Ezhamkulam Forest
Station, for granting interim custody of the vehicles, are remitted
to the learned Magistrate for fresh consideration and disposal in
accordance with law. Learned Magistrate shall dispose of the
aforesaid applications afresh within a period of two weeks from
the date of production of a certified copy of this order before the
court. It is made clear that this Court has not made any findings
with regard to the merits of the claim made by the applicants for
getting interim custody of the vehicles.
