Cri. M.C No. 2678 of 2015

Dated this the 5" day of May, 2015.

ORDER

‘The petitioners herein are the original accused Nos. 1 and
5 in C.C No.477 of 2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Hosdurg involving the offences punishable under
Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 and 153(A) IPC. The other
six accused faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and
obtained a judgment of acquittal on 29.11.2014 when all the
material witnesses including the first informant injured turned
hostile to the prosecution in view of an amicable settlement
made by the parties out of court. The case against the
petitioners was split up and refiled as C.C No.3302 of 2014.
They now seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground
of amicable settlement, and also on the ground that the very
substratum of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the
acquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against
them will not serve any purpose. In such a situation, it is quite

definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve the
 201SKERI7603

rl. MC No, 2678 of 2015 2
case and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the
prosecution, if the case against the petitioners goes to trial. In
short, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioners in C.C No.3302 of 2014 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-, Hosdurg will stand quashed
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from
prosecution,

Sdy-

P.UBAID,
JUDGE
