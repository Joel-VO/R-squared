Crl.M.C No.257 of 2015

Dated this the 15" day of January, 2015

ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is the original 7 accused in C.C
No.604/2007 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Malappuram, The offences involved in this case are under Sections
147, 148, 447, 427, 324 and 506(2) r/w 149 of the Indian Penal
Code. The original accused Nos.2 and 5 faced trial before the trial
court and obtained a judgment of acquittal under Section 248(1) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure when all the material witnesses
including the de facto complainant turned hostile to the
prosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties
out of court, The prosecution examined four witnesses in the said
case including de facto complainant and also marked Ext.P1. None
of the material witnesses examined in the case supported the
prosecution, In such a circumstance, examination of the others
was dispensed with, and evidenced was closed by the trial court.
In the absence of any evidence or incriminating circumstance, the
learned trial Magistrate acquitted the accused Nos.2 and 5. The
case against the petitioner herein was split up and refiled as C.C
No. 904/2008 and it is now transferred to the register of long
pending cases as L.P No.166/2011 before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Malappuram. The petitioner now seeks orders

quashing the prosecution as against him on the ground that the
 2019KER?001

very substratum of the prosecution case is totally lost by the
acquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against him
will not serve any purpose. Annexure I judgment in C.C
No.604/2007 shows that all the material witnesses examined by the
prosecution in the said case turned hostile in view of an amicable
settlement made by the parties out of court. In such a situation, it
is quite definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve
the case, and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the
prosecution, if the case against the petitioner goes to trial. In
short, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time,

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioner in C.C No.904/2008 before the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Malapuram, which stands transferred to
the register of long pending cases as L.P No.166/2011, will stand
quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from prosecution,

and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged.
