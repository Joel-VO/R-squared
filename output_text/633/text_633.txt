CrI.M.C.No. 7796 of 2017

Dated this the 7 day of December, 2017
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1,2 and 3 in CC
No.1277/2016 of the JFCMC, Angamaly for offences punishable
under sections 406,498A and 34 IPC.

2, It was alleged by the second respondent herein that, she
was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the first petitioner-her
husband and in-laws. On the basis of the complaint lodged, the
crime was registered and investigation was completed. According
to the petitioners and the learned counsel for the contesting
respondent, the disputes between the parties have been completely
settled to the satisfaction of both the sides. To support that,
Annexure 3 affidavit of the defacto complainant is produced. It is
stated therein that, all the matrimonial disputes have been settled
and Annexure A2 compromise was arrived at.

3. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that
the disputes have been settled and it is informed to the

investigating agency. In the light of the above, I am inclined to
 2017KERIISO

quash the proceedings.

Accordingly, Cri.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings
pursuant to C.C.No.12787/2016 of the JFCMC, Ankamaly stand

quashed.
