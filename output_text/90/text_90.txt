also, she has stated that she is not intending to proceed
with the prosecution, and she has no objection in quashing

Annexure Al FIR in Crime No.41 of 2023.

Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another;
[(2012) 10 SCC 303)], and State of Madhya Pradesh
v. Laxmi Narayan and Others; [(2019) 5 SCC 688],
this Court is of the view that the proceedings against the

petitioner can be quashed on the basis of settlement.
