BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.
Cri.M.C No.393 of 2024

Dated this the 15° day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner contends that an application for discharge filed as
C.M.P.No.3211/2021 in C.C.270/2016 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Irnjalakkuda has been pending consideration for the last three years,
without being disposed of. The proceeding sheet from the e-Court’s website has
been produced as Annexure P3. A perusal of the said proceeding sheet reveals
that though the application for discharge was posted for hearing on 08.09.2021
‘and then on 07.08.2023. On the latter posting, It was adjourned to 10.08.2023
for further hearing and thereafter, it has not been considered. The said
application has thus not been disposed of till date.

2. Having regard to the submissions made by Sr.Vinay Mathew
Joseph, learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as the Smt.V.Sreeja, learned
Public Prosecutor, ! am of the view that this CFLM.C. can be disposed of with @
direction.

3. Since the application for discharge has been pending consideration
from 2021, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Irinjalakkuda to consider and pass appropriate orders on C.M.P.No.3211/2021 in
C.C.N0.270/2016, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within a period of two
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
