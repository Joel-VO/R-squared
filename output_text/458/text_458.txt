Dated this the 7th day of January 2021

The prayer in this Criminal M.C. is to quash the
proceedings in Crime No.137/2014 of Sholayar Police
Station. Being a Criminal M.C. of the year 2014,
pertaining to a crime of 2014, a report was called for
from the jurisdictional Court. It is reported by the
Special Judge for SC/ST (POA) Act case, Mannarkkad
that, the police, on completion of investigation, has
filed a refer report finding the allegations to be false.

Therefore, nothing survives for consideration
and accordingly, the Criminal M.C. is closed.
