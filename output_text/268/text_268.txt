ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in C.C No.2/2008 on the file of
Judicial First Class Magistrate, Mattannur. He is charged with an
offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments
Act. The case in the complaint is that the petitioner/accused
borrowed money from the complainant and issued the disputed
cheque in discharge of that liability. When the cheque was presented
for collection, it was dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds.
After sending statutory notice, the complaint was filed before the
court below. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew attention of this
court to Annexure A, the reply notice, wherein a specific dispute
regarding lack of any previous acquaintance between the
complainant and the accused was raised. According to the petitioner

there was no dealing between the complainant and the accused.

Annexure B is the copy of the deposition of PW1, who is the

complainant, At the time of cross examination, specific questions

were put regardingly the identity of the accused as he was not
 CAM.CNo.1368 of 2012 2

present in court at the time of cross examination. It is seen from
Annexure B that two photographs were shown to the complainant

during cros

examination and initially he failed to identify the
accused from among the persons seen on the photographs. Learned
counsel for the petitioner submitted that the cross examination could
not be completed during the morning session and it was deferred
after lunch, Thereafter, the witness was further cross examined and
in re-examination the complainant hesitantly identified the accused
from one of the photographs. Therefore, the petitioner produced
Annexure C petition under Section 311 Cr.P.C, Leamed Magistrate

passed an order in that matter which is Annexure E. Petitioner is

aggrieved by the directions passed by the Magistrate in Annexure E
that the accused shall be present on the next hearing date during the
further examination of the complainant. According to the learned
counsel for the petitioner this is a case wherein any previous
acquaintance between the complainant and the accused is disputed.

It will cause prejudice to the accused if he is directed to appear when

the complainant is called for further examination.

2 Heard the learned counsel for the complainant/
respondent. According to the learned counsel for the complainant,
the accused was last seen by the complainant in 2007 and that is why
he could not properly identify the accused when examined on
2-2-2010, However, considering the defence taken in this matter, I
find that the Magistrate ought not have directed the
petitioner/accused to appear at the time when the complainant is
examined, considering the peculiar nature of the case. It is for the
complainant to discharge his duty of establishing the identity of the
accused, especially when there is a challenge regarding any
transaction and previous acquaintance. Therefore, that part of the
impugned order directing the accused to appear before the trial court
at the time of further examination of the complainant is set aside. To
this extent this petition is allowed,

All interlocutory applications will stand dismissed,
