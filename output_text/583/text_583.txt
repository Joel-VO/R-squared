Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

3. Petitioners have come up with this petition for
getting Annexure-A3 final report in Crime No.508/2013 of

further proceedings based on it in C.C.408/2014 pending
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Pattambi,

4. The allegation against the petitioners is that they

have tortured and harassed the de facto complainant, who
 CrLM.C.7064/2014

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, by demanding
more dowry after misappropriating her entire gold
ornaments and money.

5. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, the
learned counsel for the defacto complainant, who is the 1
respondent herein, and learned Public Prosecutor.

6. According to the petitioners, all the matters in
dispute between the petitioners and the defacto complainant
have been amicably settled and presently, the defacto
complainant has no complaints against the petitioners and,
therefore, the proceedings against the petitioners may be
quashed.

7. The defacto complainant, who is the 1*
respondent herein, has filed an affidavit affirming that all the
matters in dispute between her and the petitioners have
been amicably settled and, therefore, she has no complaints

against the petitioners and, therefore, all_ further

quashed. She has entered appearance through her
counsel. The leamed counsel for the defacto complainant
also endorses the fact that the affidavit has been sworn in
by the defacto complainant on her own volition

8. When all the matrimonial disputes have been
settled between the parties and as the defacto complainant
has no complaints against the petitioners, it is only just and
expedient in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings
referred to above.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A3
final report in Crime No.508/2013 of Pattambi Police Station
as against the petitioners and all further proceedings based
