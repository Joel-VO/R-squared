323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860.

Informant having warmed the Accused not to disturb his daughter, on 17.08.2011 at
about 8, am, on the road side near Powdikonam Junction in Uliyazhathura Village, the
Accused wrongfully restrained the Informant, showered obscene words on her,
pressed on her cheek using his finger and caused hurt to her by slapping on her left
cheek. The Accused also caught hold of her saree and pulled it, outraging her modesty
causing mental agony to herand criminally intimidated her with threat of injury to her
person, to that of her husband and to commit mischief by setting her house on fire.
‘Thereby the Accused is alleged to have committed the above-mentioned offences.

3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences,
‘under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860. On
issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was
represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records
‘were furnished to him. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records,

 3

Charge was framed for offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the
Indian Penal Code,1860. It was read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed to be tried,

4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 and CW4 were examined as PW! and PW2
respectively and Exhibit Pl was marked. CW6 is no more and his death certificate was
produced. The presence of CW2 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite
steps having been issued against him. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up
the remaining witnesses as the witnesses turned hostile to the Prosecution and
Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incrimi

ting circumstances arose against
the Accused from the deposition of the witnesses, his examination under Section 313 (1)
(©) of the CxPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the side of the
Defence.

5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for
consideration.

(a) Has the Accused wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed
offence punishable under Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?

(b) Has the Accused uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed
offence punishable under Section 294(b) of the IPC as alleged?

(©) Has the Accused on the same day, time and at the same place, voluntarily
‘caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section
323 of the IPC as alleged

(a) Has the Accused used criminal force against PW1 intending to outrage her
modesty and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 354 of the
IPC as alleged?
 4

(©) Has the Accused criminally intimidated PW1 with threat of injury to her
person and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 506(i) of the
IPC as alleged?

(f) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) to (e): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and.
for avoiding repetition.

PWI denied having statement to police to the effect that Accused assaulted her
and uttered obscene words against PWI. She admitted her signature in Exhibit PL
statement. She deposed that the Accused is his neighbor and he has not assaulted her
asalleged. She deposed that he does not intend to proceed with the case,

PW? deposed that she know both the Accused as well as PWI, but denied having
witnessed the incident and to have given statement to the police to that effect. effect
that he had witnessed the alleged incident,

T have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the
‘materials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured herself is having no
complaint or allegations that the Accused have assaulted him, He deposed that he has
ro such complaints against the Accused. The remaining witnesses were given up by
the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining the remaining witness,
‘when the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution.

On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it
is clear from the testimony of PWsI and 2 that there is no evidence to support the
Prosecution case, None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are made out from the
evidence adduced. There is nothing available on record to implicate the Accused to the

above incident. Hence, on a total consideration of facts and circumstances of the above
 case and on appreciation of the evidence adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution

has failed to prove the case against the Accused persons and therefore, Points (a) to (@)

are found in favour of the Accused persons.

8 Point No.(®: In wake of analysis and finding on the forgoing points, this point

does not arise for consideration.

In the result, Accused is found not guilty of having committed the offences
punishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal
Code,1860. He is acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC.
His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty
