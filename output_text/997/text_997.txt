This case having been finally heard by this Court on 08.01.2025 and on
15.01.2025, this Court passed the following: -

JUDGMENT.
1. This case arose on the Final Report filed by Sub Inspector of Police, City

‘Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 4699/2016 for the offences punsihable under
Sections 279 and 304 A of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the
PC’).

2. ‘The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused was the rider
of Motor Cycle bearing Registration No. KL 01-BH-1045, He drove the vehicle from
Poojappura to Thirumala via Poojappura-Thirumala road rashly, negligently, at
high speed and in such a manner as to endanger human life, at 8.00 PM on
27.10.2016 and hit the since deceased, who is the brother-in-law of CW1 near
Hindustan Latex who was crossing the road. Due to its impact, the since Deceased
fell on the road and sustained grievous injuries on his head and body. Thereafter,
n 28.10.16 the since Deceased succumbed to the injuries at the KIMS Hospital,
while undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused is alleged to have committed the
above stated offences,

3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken of the offences
‘under Section 279 and 304 A of the IPC and summons was issued to the Accused
herein. On issuance of the process, the Accused herein entered appearance and he
was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies

of all the Prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of offences
 under Sections 279 and 304A of the IPC were read over and explained to him. He
understood the same, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried,

4, From the side of Prosecution, CWs1 and 14 were examined as PW1 and PW2

respectively and Exhibits P1 to P12 were marked, The presence of CWs 4 and 5

could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been executed
against them, The remaining witnesses, were given up by the Prosecution and the
Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from
the deposition of the witnesses against the Accused, his examination under Section
313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CrPC’)

‘was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced on behalf of the Accused.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points

arise for consideration.

a. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, at high speed
and in a manner likely to endanger human life and thereby committed the

offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, at high speed
and in @ manner likely to endanger human life, resulting in the since
deceased to succumb to his injuries and thereby committed the offence

punishable under Section 304A of the IPC as alleged?

c. If so, what shall be the proper sentence?

6. Points a_and_b: These points are considered together for the sake of

brevity and to avoid repetition.

‘CWI was examined as PW1. He deposed that he is a doctor. The deceased
‘was his brother-in-law. He further deposed that he had given Exhibit PI statement
to the police regarding the incident. He deposed that he doesn’t have direct
knowledge of the incident and got information over phone that his brother-in-law

was hit by a motorcycle,
 PW2 deposed that he was the Sub Inspector of Police, City Traliic Police
Station during the relevant period of time and that he recorded the statement of
PW1. On the basis of FIS, he prepared Exhibit P9 FIR for the offence punishable
under sections. 279 and 304 A of the IPC. Exhibit P3 is the Scene Mahazar
prepared by him after visiting the place of occurrence. Exhibit Pé is the Inquest
Report of since deceased prepared by him in presence of the witnesses. Exhibit
5 (marked subject to proof) is the Postmortem Report, which reflected that the
death was due to the head injury. Ext P6 is the Vehicle Mahazar ofthe offending
vehicle prepared by him, Exhibit P7 is the report of the MVI pursuant to
inspection of the offending vehicle and Exhibit P8 is the third-party bail bond
towards release of the said vehicle. Exh

P11 is the report reflecting the correct
name and address of the Accused. Exhibit P12 is the Scene plan prepared by
Village Officer. He deposed that after completing the investigation, he filed Final
Report.

‘On going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that none of the
occurrence witnesses have been examined. CWs 2 and 3, the occurrence witnesses
‘were given up by the Prosecution as early as in the year 2019. The presence of
CWs 4 and 5 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been
issued against them. Thus, the Prosecution has miserably failed to procure
presence of the remaining witnesses in this case. The only witness examined is the
Investigating Officer, Le., PW2. ‘There are no independent witnesses examined
before this Court, In fact, there are no materials to infer and conclude that the
Accused had driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, in high speed and in a manner
as to endanger human life, thereby causing the injured to succumb to his injuries.
‘The Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence
and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Hence Points (a) and (b) are found against the Prosecution.

7. Point (c): In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are

found in favour of the Accuse, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise.
 8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279 and 304 A ofthe IPC. Hence, the Accused is
acquitted of the said offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond
stands canceled and he is set at liberty
