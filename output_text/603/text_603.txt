THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION oN
06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Crl.MC.No.7350 OF 2019(6) 2 2n20KERIIT

ORDER
Dated this the 6th day of January 2020

Petitioners are accused in C.C No.925/2016 on the files
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery for
having allegedly committed offences punishable under
Sections 341,332, 294(b), 506(i) r/w Section 34 of IPC.

2. The de facto complainant and injured is the 3°
respondent, who has appeared through counsel and filed
affidavit to the effect that the matter has been amicably
settled with the petitioners and that he has no grievance
against them. Even though Section 332 is incorporated in
the final report, it is doubtful whether Section 332 is
attracted because there is no allegation to the effect that
the injured was in the process of performing his official duty.
The mere fact that he was traveling in a police jeep as
driver of the jeep, is not sufficient to attract Section 332. A
report has been called for from the investigating officer to

the effect that the matter has been settled between the

parties. Petitioners and the 3 respondent are relatives and
 CEL.MC.No.7350 OF 2019(6) 3 2m20KERIIT
the family disputes between them have been settled
amicably. No public interest is involved

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed and the entire
proceedings in C.C, No.925/2016 pending on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery stands
quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C and the accused are

discharged.
