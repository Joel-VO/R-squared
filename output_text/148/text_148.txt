B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2018

CC.658/2017 of the court below is the main case
and the trial in the said case has been stayed through
Annexure-III order passed by this Court. It seems that as
per Annexure-IV proceedings, the court below has framed
charges in CC.661/2017, which is the counter case and
summons has been issued to CWs 1 to 3

2. The proceedings in CC.661/2017 of the court
below are also stayed so long as the order of stay in
CC.658/2017 continues.

With the said direction, this CrLM.C. is disposed of.
