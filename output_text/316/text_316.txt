“CHM.C.No.2503 of 2015”
Dated this the 24° day of April, 2015.
ORDER

Accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu
police station have filed this petition seeking a direction to
the Magistrate under section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

2, It is alleged in the petition that the first petitioner is
working in Army Headquarters in AIR SP SIG Unit, C/o. 56 APO
and petitioners 2 and 3 are parents of the first petitioner.
The petitioners were implicated as accused 1 to 3 in Crime
No.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station, Kollam district
alleging offences under sections 376, 506(ii) read with section
34 ofthe Indian Penal Code and section 3(1)(x) of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the SC and ST Act' for short), which
was registered on the basis of Annexure-A1 complaint filed by
the 4® respondent before the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Kollam, which was forwarded to the police for

investigation under section 156(3) of the Code. As per
 201SKERITI20

(CrLM.C.No 2503 of 2015 2
Annexures-A2 to AS produced by the petitioners, the allegations
made cannot be true and they have been falsely implicated in
the case. In view of the bar under section 18 of the SC and ST
Act, anticipatory bail cannot be obtained in cases where the
allegation of commission of offence under that Act has been
alleged. So the petitioners have no other remedy except to
approach this Court seeking the following relief:

“For the above reasons and other valid grounds that aro
to be urged at the time of hearing it is most humbly prayed in
the interost of justice that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
to diroct the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kollam to
release tho petitioners on bail in case of their surrender before
the Court in Annexure-A1 complaint in Crime No.362/2015 of
Anchalummoodu Police Station in the light of Annexure-A6
judgment and the decision rendered by this Hon'ble Court in
2003(3) KLT 452 in Shanu v. State of Kerala”.

3. Considering the nature of relief claimed, this Court felt
that the petition can be disposed of after hearing the counsel
for the petitioners and learned Public Prosecutor appearing for
respondents 1 to 3 and dispensing with notice to the fourth

respondent.

4. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of
 201SKERITI20

(CHL. M.C.No.2503 of 2015, 3
the dictum laid down in Shanu v. State of Kerala (2000 (3)
KLT 452), the Magistrate has got power to grant bail even if
offence under the SC and ST Act has been incorporated. The
learned counsel has relied on Annexure-AG order of this Court
in a similar matter.

5. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor.

6. Itis admitted in the petition itself that on the basis of

Annexure-Al private complaint filed by the 4" respondent
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kollam,
which was forwarded to the police for investigation by the
learned Magistrate under section 156(3) of the Code, Crime
No.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station of Kollam
district was registered against the petitioners alleging
offences under sections 376, 506(ii) read with section 34 of
the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(x) of SC and ST Act
and investigation is in progress. Section 18 of the SC and ST
Act bars grating anticipatory bail under section 438 of the
Code in a case where allegation of commission of offence
under the said Act has been alleged. But, that will not be a
ground for the petitioners to move this Court directing the

magistrate to grant bail or directing the petitioners to surrender
 201SKERITI20

(CrLM.C.No 2503 of 2015 4
before the investigating officer and directing the investigating
officer to deal with the petitioners in accordance with law. It
is true that in the decision reported in Shanu's case (cited
supra), it has been observed that merely because offence under
the SC and ST Act has been incorporated, that will not interdict
the power of the magistrate in appropriate cases to consider
the bail application if any filed and grant bail to accused

persons, if they surrender before that court. The nature of

offence mentioned in Annexure-A6 is different from the offence
mentioned in this case. Further, this Court feels that the

petition can be disposed of as follows:

If the petitioners surrender before the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court,-I, Kollam and move for bail in Crime
'No.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station, then the learned
Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the bail
application in accordance with law taking into consideration the
principle laid down in Shanu's case (cited supra) and also the
nature of offences alleged after hearing the Assistant Public
Prosecutor of that court on the date of ‘filing of the application
itself as far as possible in accordance with law.

With the above directions and observations, this petition is
 201SKERITI20

(CrLM.C.No 2503 of 2015 s
disposed of.
Office is directed to communicate a copy of this order to
the concerned court immediately.
