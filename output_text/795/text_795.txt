COMMON ORDERS

(CrL.M.C.s 9243 of 2019 & 9244 of 2019)

Dated this the 9th day of January, 2020

The petitioner is aggrieved by the dismissal of this
application under Section 451 CrP.C for release of a sum of
Rs.21,25,000/-(Rupees Twenty one lakh Twenty five thousand only)
and_Rs.5,43,000/- (Rupees Five lakh forty three thousand only)
respectively seized by the Investigating Officer in Crime No.877 of
2019 of Adimaly Police Station. The petitioner is the defacto
complainant in a complaint alleging offence under Section 395 IPC.
‘The petitioner filed an application before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Adimaly for release of the amount. But the

application was rejected on the ground that considering the nature

of the offence and the fact that it has exclusively triable by the
Court of Sessions, and that Income Tax Authorities have been
intimidate regarding the seizure and therefore, clearance from the
department has also to be obtained, and hence the amount could

not be released to the petitioner.
 cel.M.cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 220KERINISE

‘

2, The reasons stated by the learned Magistrate for not
releasing the amount to the petitioner appears to be reasonable.
But however, being such a huge amount it is always appropriate
that it may be deposited in the fixed deposit earning interest, and
therefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly, is
directed to deposit the amount in an interest bearing deposit in a

nationalised bank.
Crl.M.Cs are disposed of as above.
