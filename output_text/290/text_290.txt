Cr.M.C. No.2146 of 2020

ORDER

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.
213 of 2020 registered at the Punaloor Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections
143, 147, 294 (b), 341, 323 and 149 of IPC. The
de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime
was registered, is arrayed as the third
respondent. Annexure A2 affidavit has been filed
by the third respondent stating that the dispute
which led to registration of the crime, has been
settled amicably and he has no subsisting
grievance in the matter.

2, Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the
petitioners have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the
 202UKERIISIS
Cr.M.C. No.2146 of 2020
oe

offences alleged, nature of the injury caused
and having perused the affidavit filed by the
third respondent, the contents of which are
submitted to be true and voluntary, I am
satisfied that the dispute is settled and that no
public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility
of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction
is remote. As such, continuance of the
of

Proceedings will amount to an abuse of proc

court and hence, in view of the legal position
set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan

Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [ (2008) 4 SCC 582].
and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another

[(2012) 10 scc_303], there is no impediment in
granting the relief sought.
In the result, this Crl.M.c is allowed.
