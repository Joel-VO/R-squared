contains resume examples that will help you get started. Different formats and styles
‘are used to illustrate the various suggestions and tips contained in the handout,
“Preparing Your Resume,” also available through the Bellevue University Career Services

Center.

Remember, these are intended to serve only as examples. You should modify or change
‘as appropriate to customize your resume according to your skills, experience, education,
and the job you're applying.

Resume Wizards or Templates that are available online or
included in many word processing programs. They can be difficult
to work with, don’t allow you to present yourself in the best

create your resume as a simple document in MS Word, like the
