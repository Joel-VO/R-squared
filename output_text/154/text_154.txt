‘CRL.M.C.No. 156 of 2017
Dated this the 9" day of January, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is arrayed as an accused in
C.C.No.394/2008, pending before the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate Court, Kolkatta. The petitioner claims that he
has entrusted the matter with a counsel at Kolkatta and
he proposes to appear before the court and to seek bail.
The apprehension is that in the mean while, warrant has
been issued and he is likely to be arrested within the
jurisdiction of this Court. Learned counsel submits that
the he proposes to appear before the Kolkatta court
within the time specified by this court. The learned

counsel relied on the decision reported in Madhusoodan

Supt. of Police reported in [1992 (2) KLT 83]. In
the above decision, it was held that the place, where the
petitioner herein apprehends the arrest is of crucial

nature and having regard to that, a relief in the nature of
 2017KERDS
(CRLM.CNo, 156 of 2017 2

a pre arrest bail can be granted to meet the interest of
justice.

2. In the light of the above, I am inclined to
dispose of the above Cri.M.C. with a direction that in the
event of the petitioner being arrested, he shall be
released on bail on executing a bond of a sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) with two sureties for
the like sum each and also on a condition that he shall
appear before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court,
Kolkatta within a period of fifteen days from today. The
above order will not be in force after the expiry of fifteen
days.

The Cri.M.C. is disposed as above.
