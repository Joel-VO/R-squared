Dated this the 22” day of January, 2024

)RDER

Petitioner is the accused in S.C.No.138 of 2021 on the files of the
Assistant Sessions Court, Palakkad. He faces indictment for the offences under
Sections 8(1) and 8(2) of the Kerala Abkari Act, 1077. Due to his failure to
appear before the court, non-bailable warrant has been issued. Petitioner
challenges the non-bailable warrant issued against him.

2. Ihave heard Sri.Sarath M.S., the learned counsel for the petitioner as
well as Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor.

3. Petitioner has submitted that he is willing to appear before the court
and participate in the proceedings.

4, Having considered the submissions made across the Bar, I am of the
view that this Cri.M.C. can be disposed of with a direction.

Hence, there will be a direction to the Assistant Sessions Court, Palakkad
to consider the application for bail and for recall of warrant on the same day
itself, if flled by the petitioner on or before 31.01.2024. The non-bailable
warrant issued against the petitioner shall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.2024 to
enable the petitioner to appear before the trial court.

‘The Cri.M.C.is disposed of as above,
