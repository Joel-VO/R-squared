ORDER

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and respondents.

2, Accused Nos, 1 to 4 in Crime No, 18 of 2012 of Kasaragod
Police Station, pending as C.M.P.No.73 of 2012 before the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Kasaragod are the petitioners. The petition is filed
seeking to quash further proceedings against the petitioners in
Annexure A- FIR in Crime No.18 of 2012 of Kasaragod Police Station.

3. The offences alleged are punishable under Sections 341,
323, 324, 326 r/w 34 of the IPC.

4. The learned counsel on both sides submit that the disputes

between the parties have been amicably settled and having regard to

the resolution of the disputes between the parties, continuance of the
criminal prosecution against the petitioners is an avoidable irritant.

In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, the
Crl.M.C is disposed of quashing all further proceedings in Annexure
