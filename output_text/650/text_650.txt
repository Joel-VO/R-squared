P.S.T0 JUDGE
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

CRL.M.C. No. 8061 of 2015

(On going through Annexure-A4 order passed by the
court below, it seems that the court below has unnecessarily
made a direction that “the fact of the case pending against
the applicant be endorsed in the Passport’. A further
direction is also made by the court below to the effect that
the petitioner shall surrender the passport on its renewal
within three days of obtaining the passport. It seems that the
court has acted in a vengeance. The above said directions
are out of place and it is not required to be made. This is not

expected from a court of law also. Therefore, the said
 CRLM.C.No, 8061 of 2015

directions contained in Annexure-A4 order are expunged.

This Cri,M.C is disposed of as above.
