SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.4937 of 2016

Dated this the 3" day of August, 2016
ORDER

Notice given to the learned Public Prosecutor.

2. Heard.
3. Petitioner herein stands arrayed as the accused in

C.C.No.2692 of 2016 of N.I. Special Court, Kochi for offence

punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

4, Petitioner herein was issued with summons for
appearance. She failed to appear before the court below and
consequently, warrant was issued to her. Petitioner contends that
summons was not served on her, Petitioner submits that she is
ready and willing to surrender before the jurisdiction of the court
below and to seek bail. However, only apprehension of the
petitioner is that in the event of she surrendering before the learned
magistrate, bail application is not likely to be considered on the
same day and she is likely to be remanded.

5. Having regard to the apprehension of the petitioner
herein, I am inclined to dispose of the petition with a direction that

in the event of the petitioner herein surrendering before the learned
 2016KERI1895

magistrate and filing an application for bail, it shall be considered
by the learned magistrate on the same day itself, having regard to
the nature of contentions and all attending circumstances.

CrLM.C is disposed of.

Judge
