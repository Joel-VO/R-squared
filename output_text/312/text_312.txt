Cr.M.C. No, 2491 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.446 of
2010 of Thrissur Town East Police Station registered for the
offence punishable under Sections 448, 323, 506(1) r/w 34 of
the Indian Penal Code, which is now pending as L.P.No.52 of
2012 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Thrissur.

2. In this petition, it is stated that the petitioner was
enlarged on bail during the crime stage and subsequently after
the appearance before the court below, he was enlarged on
bail. Thereafter, the petitioner got an employment abroad and
therefore he could not appear before the court below when
summons was issued to him. Consequently, his bail bond was
cancelled and a non bailable warranted was issued against
him. Now the case against the first accused stands posted to

2.5.2015.

CrLM.C. No, 2491 of 2015

3. Though he is willing to appear before the court
below, he reasonably apprehends that his bail application will
not be considered by the court below on the date of his
appearance itself and he may be remanded to Judicial Custody,
pending consideration of the bail application.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a
direction to the learned magistrate to consider the application
‘on the date of his appearance itself.

I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will adopt such
a method mechanically without application of mind to see that
the petitioner is incarcerated. However, to secure the interest
of Justice, the learned Magistrate is directed to dispose of the
bail application on the date of appearance itself.
