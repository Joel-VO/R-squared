Crl.M.C.No. 91 of 2015
Dated this the 8" day of January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the eight accused in
S.C.No.131/2013 of the Court of Session, Kalpetta. Crime in this
case was registered under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 294(b),
324, 427, 308 and 506 IPC read with Section 149 IPC, on the
complaint of one Junaise, that the petitioners assaulted him and
his friends Ajnas, Sainul Abid, Mujeeb Rahman and Muhammed
Shafi, as part of a criminal design made by them, and inflicted
injuries on their body with weapons with the knowledge of
consequence that the injuries may cause death. The petitioners
now seek orders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that
they and the injured persons including the first informant have
come to terms amicably out of court. The first informant, Junaise
is the 2“ respondent herein, and the other persons who
sustained injuries are the respondent Nos. 3 to 6. The
respondents 2 to 6 have filed affidavit to the effect that they

have settled the whole dispute with the accused, and they have
 201SKERZNG

(CaM. No 912018 2
no grievance or complaint. I am well satisfied that there is a real
and genuine settlement between the parties, and I also find that
Section 308 IPC was in fact incorporated by the police on the
basis of a purely hypothetical statement. This is a simple case of
assault in which the respondents sustained some simple injuries.
Any way, the dispute now stands settled. It is definite that
continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose in the
above circumstances, because nobody will support the
prosecution, if the case goes to trial.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is allowed, The prosecution in
S.C.No.131/2013 of the Court of Session, Kalpetta as against the
petitioners 2 to 8, and in C.P.No.3/2013 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Mananthavady as against the first petitioner
herein, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution.
The bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged.
