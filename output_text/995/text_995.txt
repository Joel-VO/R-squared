This case finally came up for consideration and hearing on 01.02.2025 and
this Court on the 06.02.2025 delivered the following

JUDGMENT.

1. This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of
Police, Karamana Police Station in Crime No. 1610/2016 for the offences
punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860(hereinafter referred to as theIPC’)

2. ‘The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused Persons
inorder to wreck vengeance against the Informant for having required the 2"
Accused to dim the headlight of his scooter; in furtherance of their common
intention, voluntarily assaulted the Informant on 21.10.2016 at 8.30 pm at the
public road premises near Killipalam over bridge. The 1* Accused wrongfully
restrained the Informant and fisted on his chest repeatedly and pushed him on the
road, The 2" Accused showered obscene words on the Informant. Thereby the
Accused are alleged to have committed the above mentioned offences.

3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the
offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the IPC. On issuance of process,
the Accused Persons entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on
bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all
relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them, Particulars of Offences were

 read over and the same was read over and explained to them, to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4, From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1 and Exhibit
PI was marked. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the
‘material witness, the injured herself had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution,
‘Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses,
the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed
with. No Defence evidence was also adduced.

5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for
consideration:

(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence
punishable under section 294 (b)r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged

(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable
under Section 323 of the IPC as alleged?

(©) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under
Section 341 of the IPC as alleged?

(a) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

6

Points (a) to (6): These points are considered together for the sake of
‘and for avoiding repetition.

PWI deposed that he sustained injury in the alleged incident. He was hit
‘and on account of the same, he fell down, He deposed that he had given Exhibit
PI First Information Statement to the police officials regarding the alleged
incident. He deposed that he does not remember the exact date of the incident
 4

‘and the same occurred pursuant to 7.00 pm at Killippalam. PW1 categorically
denied the identity of the persons who had allegedly assaulted him and further
deposed that he does not know how many people had so assaulted him. He
further deposed that he could not identify the persons who had allegedly assaulted
him and that he does not know whether the Accused persons were amongest them.

On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on
record, it is evident that the injured himself has deposed against the version of the
Prosecution, Though PW1 admitted to have sustained injuries, and having given
Exhibit P1 statement to the Police; he categorically denied knowledge as to the
identity of the people who had allegedly assaulted him. Further he is not having a
‘case that it was the Accused Persons who had allegedly assaulted him. There is no
evidence forthcoming as regards the ingredients of the offences alleged. The
remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution since no purpose would be
served by examining them in the aforesaid circumstance wherein the injured
himself has turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Thus, there is nothing on the
record s0 as to implicate the Accused Persons to the alleged incident. Hence Points
(@) to (©) are found in favour of the Accused.

7. Point (@): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not
arise for consideration.

In the result, the Accused Nos.1 and 2 are found not guilty of having
committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the
IPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the
CrPC. Their bail bond stands cancelled and they are set at liberty.
