CeL.MC.No. 8317 of 2018 2

Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.c.

2. Petitioner is the accused in S.C.No.41 of
2018 on the file of the Add. Sessions Court-IT,
Kalpetta. He was granted bail during the
investigation on condition that he shall surrender
his passport. Accordingly, he has surrendered his
Passport in the committal court. He filed an
application in the trial court to return the
passport. So that he may renew it by Annexure-III
order. The trail court has dismissed it on the ground
that the passport was not surrendered in that court.
After hearing both sides, I am satisfied that a
direction may be issued to the Sessions Court to
return the passport so that the petitioner may renew
it and surrender it within ten days of its delivery
to him, If the passport has not been sent to the

trial court the learned Sessions Judge shall send for
