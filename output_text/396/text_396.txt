Cri.M.C. No.4273 of 2016

Dated this the 1" day of August, 2016

ORDER

1.The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime
No.257 of 2016 of the Aroor Police Station. He is
accused of having committed offence punishable under
sections 323 and 324 of IPC. The 2” respondent is the
victim.

2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the
Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.
State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of
other cases which include Narinder Singh and others
v. State of Punjab and anr. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and
Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand
(2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above

proceeding.

 2016KERI662

(CrL.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 2

3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above
judgments have delineated the circumstances and the
cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can
be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the
purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed
that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal
proceedings.

4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of
court settlement and there is no acrimony between
them at present. All the disputes have been amicably
resolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony.
The respondent No 2 has filed an affidavit wherein he
assert that he has no objection in terminating the
proceedings.

5.The gist of the allegation is that on 14.3.2016 at about

11.45 p.m., the petitioner had stabbed the 2”
 2016KERI662
(CrL.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 3

respondent with a knife causing injuries.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that no other cases of heinous nature are reported
against the petitioner.

7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the
submissions made across the bar and I have also gone
through the materials on record.

8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit in which he asserts
that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in
quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between
the parties have been resolved and the parties are
living in peace and harmony .

9. It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in
nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is
also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of
compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as
the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to

continue, it would not serve any purpose as the
 (CrL.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 4

possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only
result in putting the de facto complainant and the
accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice.
Settlement will augur well for the interest of the
community and will enable the parties to live in peace
and harmony.

10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in
quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case
falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex
Court in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases
referred to above.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings against the petitioner, who is the accused
in Crime No.257 of 2016 of Aroor Police Station, are
quashed.
