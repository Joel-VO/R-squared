SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.8516 of 2017

Dated this the 3" day of January, 2018
ORDER

Petitioners are arrayed as accused in Crime No.622 of

2015 of Anchalumoodu Police Station for offences punishable under
sections 420, 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that after the
marriage of the first petitioner with the third respondent herein, she
was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the petitioners in
connection with demand for dowry. Crime was registered and
investigation is progressing. In the meanwhile, petitioners have
approached this Court contending that the disputes have now been
resolved and the parties have approached the Family Court seeking
divorce by filing a joint petition evidenced by Annexure-A4.

3. It seems that the parties have settled the dispute.
Learned counsel for the third respondent submitted that she has no
objection in quashing the proceedings in the light of the settlement
arrived at between the parties. Learned Public Prosecutor, on
instructions, submitted that the parties have resolved their dispute
and the petitioners are not involved in any other crime. Having
considered these facts and the fact that the issue arises from a

matrimonial discord, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under
 2018KERIAS

section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the criminal proceedings.
In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
arising from Crime No.622 of 2015 of Anchalumoodu Police Station
will stand quashed.
