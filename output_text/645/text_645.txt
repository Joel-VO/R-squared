ORDER

 CRLMC:792318 ‘ 2019KERIS

6. _ In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],
the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High
Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between
the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal
proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita
Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that
it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of

matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and

terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to
‘exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such
proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process
of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be
quashed. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of
the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking
its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the

proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A final

report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners
 CRLMC:792318 5 2019KERIS

now pending as C.C No.1758 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial

Magistrate of First Class-II, Kochi are quashed.
