Cri.M.C..No. 4917 OF 2014

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the original accused Nos.4 & 7
in C.C. No.709/2005 of the Judicial First class Magistrate
Court- II, Kollam. Of the eleven accused seven faced trial
before the Learned Magistrate and obtained judgment of
acquittal on 30/4/2008 when all the material witnesses turned
hostile during trial in view of an amicable settlement made by
the parties out of court. The case against the accused
Nos.4,6,7 & 9 was split up and refiled as C.C. 1111/2008. Now

it is pending as L.P, No.52/2014 as against the peti

ners,
herein before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II,
Kollam. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the
prosecution against them on the ground that in the above

situation, where everybody turned hostile during trial,

continuance of the prosecution will not serve any purpose.
Annexure II judgment shows that the prosecution examined

two material witnesses in C.C. No.709/2005, but they did not

(Cr.M.. No.4917/2014 2

in any manner support the prosecution. Offence involved in the
case are under Sections 143,147,148,447,427 and 506 (ii) read
with Section 149 1.P.C. and under section 27 of Arms Act. A
perusal of Annexure II judgment shows that the material witness
turned hostile in view of a settlement made by the parties. In
such a situation, the prosecution cannot, in any manner, improve
the case against the petitioners herein because if their case goes
to. trial, those witnesses will not support the prosecution. I find
that continuance of the prosecution against the petitioners will be
a sheer waste of time.

In the result, Cri.M.C is allowed. The prosecution against
the petitioners, as original accused Nos. 4 & 7 in C.C.
No.709/2005 now pending as L.P. No.52/2014 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam will stand quashed under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
