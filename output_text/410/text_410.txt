ORDER

1.The petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of
2015 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate
Court, Ernakulam. They have been charged for having
committed offences punishable under sections 341, 323,
326 read with 34 of the IPC.

2. The 2+ respondent is the de facto complainant and the
son-in-law of the 1* petitioner herein. It appears that
there were matrimonial disputes between the 2-
respondent and Archana, the daughter of the 1*
petitioner. The prosecution allegation is that on
10.5.2012 at 12.00 noon, the petitioners had assaulted
the de facto complainant causing injuries.

3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,

24 respondent as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

CH.M.C.450672016 2

4.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the disputes
between the 2s respondent and Archana, the daughter of
the 1* petitioner, has been settled amicably and the
marriage has also been dissolved by a decree of divorce.
Referring to Annexure-A4 affidavit filed by the 2”
respondent it is submitted that the 2~ respondent has
asserted that he does not wish or intend to continue the
criminal proceedings against the petitioners any further.

5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that the petitioners are not persons with criminal
antecedents.

6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar
that the parties have amicably settled their disputes by
their own free will and without any kind of pressure,

influence or coe!

n. The compromise, it is felt, is
voluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon.

ae 5 ¢ Punjab (2032) 20 sce
303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the
 2016KERI666

CH.M.C.450672016 3
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of
disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an
end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated
in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab. (2014) 6 SCC
466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of
Jharkhand and Another 2014 (9) SCC 653...

8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel
and on perusing the records, it appears that the offences
are entirely personal in nature and do not affect public
peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of
proceedings on account of compromise would bring about
peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the
prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any
purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and
bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto
complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and
prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of

the community and will enable the parties to live in peace
 CH.M.C.450672016 4
and harmony.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings against the petitioners, who are accused
Nos.1 to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of 2015 on the file of the
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam,

shall stand quashed.
