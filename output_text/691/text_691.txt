Cri. M. C. No. 8476 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER
The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.1041/2017 of
Pattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District for offences
punishable under Sections 323 & 341 of IPC. It is alleged by the
prosecution that due to previous enmity, on 23.09.2017 at 3.00
p.m., the petitioner herein pushed down the de facto complainant
and kicked her. When the daughter intervened, she was also

pushed down. Alleging the offences committed, complaint was

laid and FIR was registered. Annexure Al is the FIR in the above
crime.

2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending
that pending the investigation parties, who are neighbours, have
settled their disputes. To buttress the above contention, learned
counsel for the petitioner relied on Annexures A2 and A3
affidavits allegedly affirmed by respondents 2 and 3, who are the
de facto complainant and the injured. Learned counsel for the
respondents 2 and 3 acknowledged the due execution of the

above affidavits and reiterated the settlement arrived at between

the parties.

Crl.M, C. No, 8476 of 2017

3. The learned Public Prosecutor endorsed the settlement
arrived at between the parties and stated that the statement of
‘one of the respondent has been recorded.

4, There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner
is involved in any other crime. Essentially, the dispute arose from
a property dispute. Having considered these facts, | am inclined
to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. treating the
dispute as a purely personal one, without involvement of any
larger question of public importance.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime
No.1041/2017 of Pattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District

stand quashed.
