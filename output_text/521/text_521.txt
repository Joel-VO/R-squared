SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cr1.M.C.No. 5894 of 2017

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018

ORDER

The petitioners were arrayed as the accused in CC
No.1257/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Kakkanad,

2. The first respondent herein, who is the defacto complainant
before the court below, filed an application under section 91 of
CrP.C.for a direction to the first accused, the Managing Partner of
the partnership firm,to produce the partnership deed, audit report
and an agreement dated 28/4/2016 on an allegation that the first
accused was in possession of the above three documents. The first
accused did not chose to file objections to the above application.
Hence, the court below by Annexure A3 order directed the first
accused to produce the partnership deed, audit report and also the
agreement dated 28/5/2016 within a period of three weeks from
today. This is under challenge in this Cr.M.C.

3. Though several arguments were advanced by the learned

counsel for the first accused, I am not inclined to accept those
 2018KERZ09
(CHLM.CNo 5894/2017 2

contentions, However, leamed counsel for the first accused
contended that the first accused was not in possession of the above
documents. If that be so, the first accused will be free to file an
affidavit before the court below at the earliest, on or before the
next posting date, affirming the above fact. Thereupon, the defacto
complainant will be free to let in other evidence to substantiate the
contentions.

Cr.M.C.is accordingly disposed of.
