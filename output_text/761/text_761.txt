 Cel.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 2019KERII6

ORDER

The petitioner faces prosecution proceedings in two cases
pending before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II, Thrissur. In
C.C.No.4503 of 2014, the de facto complainant is his wife. In the said
case, he is being proceeded against for having committed offence
punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. In C.C.No.4230 of 2014,
the de facto complainant is his daughter and he is accused of having
‘committed offence punishable under Sections 323, 354A, 506(i) and
509 of the IPC. Both these cases are sought to be quashed by these
petitions filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

2. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, the learned counsel appearing for the respective de facto
complainants in both cases, who have been arrayed as the 2”
respondent in these proceedings, and the learned Public Prosecutor.

3. The learned counsel appearing for both sides submitted that
the entire disputes were referred to the Ernakulam Mediation Centre
and the parties were able to arrive at a settlement. As per the terms,
the petitioner had agreed to pay Rs.28,00,000/- to his wife and
Rs.20,00,000/- to his daughter. The de facto complainants had agreed

to hand over the title deeds of the residential home and the keys of
 Crl.MC.No. 8849 6 8851 of 2017 2019iKERi96
the building

4. When the case was taken up today, the learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner has handed over two demand drafts for
the agreed amount and the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents have handed over the documents as well as the keys. It
is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for both sides that the
entire disputes having been settled, the continuance of proceedings
against the petitioner is an abuse of process.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded and
she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.

6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in
Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex
Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take
note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the
wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in
Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the
courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If

the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes
 CrL.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 2MHOIKE RANG
5

amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of
law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under
Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue
would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of
justice also require that the proceedings be quashed.

7. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of
the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its
extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the
proceedings.

In the result, these petitions will stand allowed. Annexure-A1
final reports in both cases and all proceedings pursuant thereto
against the petitioner now pending as C.C. Nos.4230/2014 and
C.C.No. 4503/2014 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II,

Thrissur are quashed.
