ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.196/2015
of Edakkara Police Station on the files of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court, Nilambur. The above
crime was registered for the offences punishable
under Sections 498A and 406 read with Section 34 of
the Indian Penal Code. The second respondent was the
wife of the first petitioner and other petitioners are
the in-laws of the second respondent. The above crime
was registered on the basis of the private complaint
filed by her before the lower court and after
investigation the crime was registered against the
petitioners under Annexure-II F.I.R. During the
pendency of investigation, the dispute between the
first petitioner and the second respondent has been

settled out of court and owing to the settlement the
 201SKER7IS7
(CxLM.C.23272015-B

second respondent is not interested to prosecute the
petitioners any further. The second respondent has
filed Annexure-III affidavit stating that she does not

intend to proceed with the prosecution against the

petitioners. This petition is filed with a prayer to
quash Annexure-II F.I.R. in view of the settlement
entered into between the first petitioner and the
second respondent.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,
the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel
for the respondents.

3. Both counsel appearing for the respective
parties urged for quashing Annexure~II F.I.R. invoking
the inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and
the learned counsel for the petitioners cited Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

4. I have meticulously considered the decision
laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT
108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the

Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question
 201SKER7IS7
(CxLM.C.23272015-B

whether the High Court has power to quash criminal
proceedings involving non—compoundable offences on
the basis of the compromise reached between the
offender and the victim and answered as given below:

“87. The position that emerges from the
above discussion can be summarised thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a
criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
distinct and different from the power given
to a criminal court for compounding the
offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent
power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
limitation but it has to be exercised in
accord with the guideline engrafted in such
power viz'(i) to secure the ends of justice or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court. In what cases power to quash the
criminal proceeding or complaint or F.LR.
may be exercised where the offender and
victim have settled their dispute would
depend on the facts and circumstances of
each case and no category can be prescribed.
However, before exercise of such power. the
High Court must have due regard to the
nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity. etc.,
cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
victim or victim's family and the offender
have settled the dispute. Such offences are
not private in nature and have serious
impact on society. Similarly, any
compromise between the victim and offender
in relation to the offences under special
statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act
or the offences committed by public
 201SKER7IS7
(CxLM.C.23272015-B

servants while working in that capacity etc:
cannot provide for any basis for quashing
criminal proceedings involving such
offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
flavour stand on different footing for the
purposes of quashing, particularly the
offences arising from commercial. financial,
mercantile. civil. partnership or such like
transactions or the offences arising out of
matrimony relating to dowry. etc.. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically
private or personal in nature and the parties
have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, High Court may quash
criminal proceedings if in its view. because
of the compromise between the offender and
victim, the possibility of conviction is
remote, bleak and continuation of criminal
case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
caused to him by not quashing the criminal
case despite full and complete settlement
and compromise with the victim. In other
words, the High Court must consider whether
it would be unfair or contrary to the
interest of justice to continue with the
criminal proceeding or continuation of the
criminal proceeding would tantamount to
abuse of process of law despite settlement
and compromise between the victim and
wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
justice, it is appropriate that criminal case
is put to an end and if the answer to the
above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
quash the criminal proceeding.”

5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the

question to be considered, in the instant case, is,
 201SKER7IS7
(CxLM.C.23272015-B

whether the non—compoundable offence involved in
this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the
inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the
offences alleged against the petitioners will not
come under the category of non-compoundable
offences, which are specifically excluded from
composition, in the exercise of inherent power under
Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by
the de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute
between the accused and the victim had been amicably
settled and at present the de facto complainant has
no subsisting grievance at all. The de facto
complainant does not want to proceed with
prosecution against the accused. Full and final
settlement and compromise with the victim are
evidenced by Annexure-III. In view of the compromise
between the petitioners and the victim, I find that the
possibility of conviction is remote, bleak, and

continuation of the criminal case would put the
 201SKER7IS7
(CxLM.C.23272015-B

parties to great oppression, prejudice and also
tantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The
present criminal prosecution against the accused
must be put to an end to secure the interest of
justice.

6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings
against the petitioners in Crime No.196/2015 of
Edakkara Police Station on the files of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court, Nilambur will stand
quashed, in the exercise of jurisdiction and power
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
