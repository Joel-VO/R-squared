‘This case having been finally heard on today the court on the same day delivered

the following :-
JUDGMENT
1. This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Pettah Police

Station in crime No. 1851/2017 against the accused, 14 in numbers, alleging

commission of offences w's 143, 147, 149, 294(b), 323, 447 and 427 of IPC.

‘Cognizance is not taken for the offence punishable ws 294(b) of IPC,

‘The prosecution case in brief is that on 19/11/2017 at about 5.45 pm, the

accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of

their common object, criminally trespassed into the Ayappa Thavalam inside
the property of CWI near Karikkakam SNDP Sakha Guru Mandiram and

‘committed mischief by destructing the tube light, utensils and chairs thereby

‘causing loss to the tune of %.5,0001-. When CW1 questioned the accused, the

1 accused pushed her down thereby causing injury and hurt to her. The

accused thereby committed the offences as alleged against them.

3. All accused appeared on summons and they were furnished with copies of all
relevant prosecution records. After hearing, particulars of the offences ws
143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and 427 of IPC were read over and explained to them
and they pleaded not guilty.

4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CWI and CW2 as PWI and

and PW2 and marked a document as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses examined

did not support the prosecution, CW3 to CW12 were given up by the learned
 4
APP. Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no
incriminating circumstances brought out in evidence against accused,
‘examination ws 313 of Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce

any evidence,

Heard both the sides.
‘The points that arise for consideration are:~

Whether the accused Nos. 1 t0 14 had committed the offences

Punishable ws 143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and 427 of IPC, as alleged?
2, What shall be the sentence or order?

Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 2
‘witnesses and 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 deposed
affirming the incident, but she stated that she was not assaulted. She admitted
her signature in Ext.PL, but categorically stated that she could not identify any
of the accused. PW2 cited as occurrence witness denied having witnessed the
alleged incident. Since the material witnesses tured hostile to prosecution,
the leamed Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses.
From the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged
‘or to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to
prove that the accused committed the offences ws 143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and
427 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution,

Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos.1 to 14
are found not guilty of the offences punishable ws 143, 147, 149, 323, 447
and 427 of IPC they are acquitted ws 255(1) of CEPC and set at liberty,

‘cancelling their bail bonds.
