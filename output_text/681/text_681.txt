The revision petitioner filed the above said C.M.P
under Section 451 CrPC. praying for releasing the

that the vehicle had been already confiscated under the

provisions of the Kerala Forest Act. Since the vehicle
had been already confiscated by the authorised officer,
Annexure A2 order dismissing the petition filed by the
petitioner under Section 451 CrP.C. does not warrant

any interference by this Court.

In the result, this Crl.M.C stands dismissed.
However, this order will not stand in the way of the
petitioner in challenging the order of confiscation, in

accordance with law.
