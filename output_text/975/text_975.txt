This case having been finally heard on 12.12.2024 and this Court on the
18.12.2024 delivered the following: -

JUDGMENT.
1, This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of
Police, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 431 of 2009 for the offences
punishable under Sections 279, 337 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 hereinafter
referred to as ‘the IPC’) r/w Section 134(b) of Motor Vehicles Act.

2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: : Accused, the driver of the
car bearing registration No. KL-01-AL-6563 drove the same at about 9.00 am pm
on 14.11.2008 through Kesavadasapuram -Ulloor road rashly, negligently and in a
manner as to endanger human life and hit the Informant while she was walking
through the road at the same direction. Due to its impact, the Informant fell on
the road and sustained serious injury on his head, right hand and contusion in the
right knee. The Accused did not inform the same to the. Thus the Accused is
alleged to have committed the abovesaid offences.

3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279, 337 of
the IPC r/w 134(b) of Motor Vehicle Act and took the case on file. On issuance of
process, the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was
represented by a Counsel of his own choice, Copies of all relevant prosecution
records were furnished to him. The particulars of offence under Sections 279, 337
IPC riw 134(b) of Motor Vehicles Act were read over and explained to him, to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

 3

4, From the side of Prosecution, CW1 alone was examined as PW 1 and Exhibit
PI marked. The presence of CW2 and 3 could not be procured by the Prosecution
and Section 82 steps also effected against them. The remaining witnesses were
given up by the Learned APP as the material witness turned hostile to the case of
Prosecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of
the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC
‘was dispensed with. No Defence evidence was adduced.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points
arise for consideration.

‘a, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a
manner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby
committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b, Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently
in @ manner endangering the life and personal safety to PW1, causing him
hurt and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337 IPC
as alleged?

¢. Has the accused failed to inform the police, violating the mandate
under section 134(b) of MV Act and thereby commit the offence punishable
134 (b) of Motor Vehicles Act?

Iso, the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) to (€): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and to avoid repetition.

PWI deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred at Ulloor. He
doesn’t remember the date of occurrence. It has been ten years since then. He
sustained fracture on his head and hand and had gone to Government Medical
College Hospital for treatment. Further he deposed that he gave Exhibit P1
statement to the police. He deposed that the incident occurred while he was on
 4

his way to his workplace, He denied knowledge as to the reason for the incident
and further that he is not able to identify the person who drove the vehicle and
that he doesn’t know if the Accused was the driver or not. He further deposed that
he had already filed a Compromise Petition before this Court.

‘On going through the evidence and the materials on record, itis pertinent to
note that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no
‘case that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused himself. In
fact, PW1 categorically deposed that he does not know the Accused and has no
‘case that it was the Accused who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the
Prosecution so as to implicate him. The presence of occurrence witnesses CWs 2
and 3 could not be procured by the Prosecution and steps effected against them.
‘The remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as the material witness,
the injured himself had turned hostile to the Prosecution and also no purpose
‘would be served in examining the remaining witnesses in the said circumstance,
‘Thus, there is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the witnesses
‘50 as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused by the
aforesaid acts committed the above offences, having caused PW1 to sustain
injuries, Furthermore, it is admitted by PW1 that already a compromise petition
was filed by him. The same was rejected as the offences alleged includes those
which are non-compoundable in nature. The Prosecution has thus failed to
‘substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the
guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt, much less rash or negligent driving
against him. Hence these points are found in favour of the Accused.

9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found
in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 337 of the IPC r/w 134(b) of Motor
Vehicles Act . Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section
255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
