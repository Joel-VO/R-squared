Crl.M.C.Nos.1602 and 1866 of 2016

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
The petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 respectively in

C.C.No.236/2014 of the Chief Judici

Magistrate's Court,
Ernakulam based on the final report in Crime No.1814/2014 of
the Emakulam Central Police Station for the offences under
Sections 406, 418, 420 and 426 IPC.

2. _ In brief, the allegation is that the petitioners have
not paid the entire commission as agreed by them based on an
agreement to CW1.

3. On going through the matter, it seems that, at the
most the liability has arisen from a breach of contract and
nothing more, for which civil action alone is maintainable.
When it is only a breach of contract, the offences alleged
against the petitioners are not legally sustainable. Therefore,
all further proceedings in C.C.No.236/2014 of the Chief Judicial
Magistrate's Court, Ernakulam as against the petitioners herein
are hereby quashed.
