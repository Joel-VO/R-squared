ORDER

This Cri.M.C. under Section 482 of CrPC is filed by the
‘sole accused in Crime No.354/2007 of Aranmula Police Station,
Pathanamthitta District, which is now pending before the
Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Pathanamthitta, as LP
No.83/2013, for a direction to the learned Magistrate, to
consider his bail application on the date of surrender itself.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit
that, the petitioner was abroad and so he could not appear
before the Court in time. The crime is of the year 2007 and his
case was transferred to LP register in the year 2013. Even
then, since his limited prayer is only to consider his bail
application on the date of surrender itself, this Cri.M.C. can be
allowed.

In the result, the Crl.M.C. is also allowed as follows:

The petitioner is at liberty to surrender before the Judi

Magistrate of First Class-1, Pathanamthitta, in LP No.83/2013,
