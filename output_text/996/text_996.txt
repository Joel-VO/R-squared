Police Station in Crime No. 3189/2017 for the offences punishable under Sections 279,

337 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the IPC’)

2 The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused was the rider of
Autorickshaw bearing Registration No, KI 01 BL 6120. He drove the vehicle from

Manvila to Arasumoodu rashly, negligently and in such a manner as to endanger
human life through Manvila-Arasumoodu road about 7.30 am on 24.062017 and hit
the since deceased who was riding bicycle bearing Registration Number KL 02.T 2743,
near the road turning tothe Government Relief LP. School Kulathoor, while suddenly
tuming the auto to enter into the said road. CW was the pilion rider. Due to is

and body. CW3 also sustained severe injury. Thereafter, on 24.06.2017, at 12.50 AM,
the since deceased succumbed to his injures atthe Govt. Medical College Hospital
While undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused i alleged to have committed the

above stated offences.
 3
3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken for the offences
under Section 279, 337 and 304A of the IPC and summons was issued to the Accused
herein. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance and he was enlarged
fon bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all the
Prosecution records were furnished to him, The particulars of offences under Sections
279,337 and 304A of the IPC were read over and explained to the Accused and he

tundlerstood the same, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the sie of Prosecution, CW 1,2,5 and 19 were examined as PW1 to PW4
respectively and Exhibits PI to PIS were marked. The Prosecution further filed to
procure the presence of CW3 and CW4, despite granting sufficient opportunities and
the Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from
the deposition of the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)
(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CrPC’) was

dispensed with. No evidence adduced on behalf of the Accused.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points arise

for consideration.

(2) Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently and in a manner
likely to endanger human life and thereby committed the offence punishable

under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?
 4
(b) Has the Accused by his act of having driven the vehicle in the said
manner caused hurt to since deceased and CW3 and thereby committed the

offence punishable u/S. 337 IPC as alleged?

Has the Accused driven his vehicle in the said manner resulting the
since deceased to succumb to his injuries and thereby committed the offence

punishable under Section 304A of the IPC as alleged?

d. Ifo, what shall be the proper sentence?

6. Points (a) to (o): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity

and to avoid repetition.

PWI deposed that the since deceased is his nephew and that the incident
occurred at 2017, around 7.30, AM at Manila. He deposed that he was informed of
the same by the mother of since deceased. When he reached the hospital the since
deceased was under treatment at casuality. The accident occurred when the bike
driven by the since deceased got hit bya autorickshaw and that his death occurred on
the same day then, atthe hospital. He further deposed that based on the information,

he gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police.

PW2 deposed that since deceased is his son. The deceased died in the incident
in this case at 2012 June 23. He was aged nearly 18 years on the said date. He came to

know about the incident when he was informed of the same by his wife. He had not
 5
‘gone in the bike from the house, rather he had walked and later got into his friend’s
bike. He deposed that he never used to give bike to the since deceased, although he

used to ride motorcycles.

PWS deposed that he lives in Arasumoodu. He isa trade Union employee. He
does not have any previous acquaintance with the since deceased. He was coming on
the said route after unloading and found an auto and bike lying therein having
collided with each other, He heard that the injured were taken to the hospital. The
incident occurred in 2017, but he doesn’t remember its number and denied having
«given statement to the police. He further denied having given statement to the police
to the effect that he saw the auto driven by the Accused hitting the bike of the since
deceased and that the injured were thrown away from the bike due to its impact. This,

‘was so when his attention was drawn to his previous statement by the Learned APP.

The Officer who had registered the crime was examined as PW4. He deposed
that he was the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police City Trafic Police Station during the
relevant period of time and that he recorded the statement of PW1. On the basis ofthe
Exhibit PI statement, he registered Exhibit P3 Fist Information Report for the offences
punishable under Sections.279, 337 and 304 A of the IPC. He identified the records
prepared by the Investigating Oificer, CW20 who fs laid up. He is acquainted with the
signature and handwriting of the Investigating Officer. Exhibit P6 is the Scene

Mahazar prepared by CW20 after visiting the place of occurrence. Exhibit P7 is the
 6

Inquest Report of deceased. Exhibit P9 is the Mahazar pertaining to the

nce of the
Accused. Exhibits P9, P10 and P11 are the Mahazars of the records of the vehicle
respectively. Exhibits P14 is the Wound certificate. Exhibit P1 is the postmortem
certificate. Exhibit P16 is the scene plan prepared by village officer. The Accused was
released on bail upon Exhibit PI7 Bail Bond. Exhibit P18 is the report reflecting, the
correct name and address of the Accused and after completing the investigation, PW4

filed Final Report.

(On going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1 does not
have any direct knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the witnesses
‘who claimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of the Prosecution.
‘The contradiction in the statement of the occurrence witness is not proved. The other
occurrence witnesses did not turn before this Court despite effecting steps under
Section 82 of the CrPC. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned
Assistant Public Prosecutor. In absence of any other corroborating circumstances,
‘except for the documents put forth by PW1 and his oral testimony, there is nothing on
record so as to implicate the Accused in this crime, There are no independent
‘witnesses examined before this Court. There is nothing on record as revealed from the
deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that
the Accused had driven his car in a rash and negligent manner, causing the injured to

succumb to his injuries. The Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing
 7
proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond

reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.

7. Point d: In light of the above, since those points are found in favour of the

Accused, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise.

8. Inthe result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the offence
punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the Accused is
acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of the CePC. His bail bond stands
cancelled and he i et at bert.
