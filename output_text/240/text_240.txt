ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in $.T.No.2777/2017 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Chalakkudy. Petitioner
is facing prosecution for the offence punishable under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Due to the failure
on the part of the petitioner to appear before the trial court, a
non bailable warrant has been issued. Hence, this petition.

. Sri,Praveen K.Joy, the learned counsel for the p

tioner,
submitted that summons had not been served on the petitioner
and therefore he was unaware of the specific posting date. It
is also submitted that petitioner is willing to appear before the
trial court and seek bail, especially since the offence is a
bailable one,

1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.

Considering the nature of order that I propose to pass, notice
 4.

2024KERIGAG

to the 2™ respondent is dispensed w'
Since the petitioner is an accused in an offence punishable
under Section 138 of NI Act, I am of the view that the
learned Magistrate ought to consider the application for bail

and recall of warrant on the same day itself.

. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-I, Chalakkudy, to consider the application for

recall of warrant and for grant of bail, if any, filed by the
petitioner in $.T.No.2777/2017 positively on the same day of
his appearance.
‘The Crl.M.C.is disposed of.
