ORDER

It is the case of the year 2015. Adv. Smt.

Sheeja appeared on behalf of the counsel for the

petitioners. The counsel for the petitioners
remained absent. Earlier it was dismissed for
default. It was restored and again came up for
hearing. This would show what is behind it. Hence

the Crl.M.C. is dismissed for non-prosecution.
