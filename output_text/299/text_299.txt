ORDER

The petitioners are the accused in Crime
No.187/2014 on the files of the Manjeshwar Police
Station, now pending as C.C.No.846/2014 on the files of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,
Kasaragod. The first petitioner is the husband, the
second petitioner is the mother-in-law and the third
petitioner is the brother-in-law of the de facto
complainant. The marital discordancy between the
first petitioner and the first respondent culminated
in a criminal prosecution under Sections 498A and 23
read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and
Annexure-Al final report has been filed. Now the
case is pending for trial. Now the grievances of the
petitioners are that the parties have amicably settled
the matter and the first respondent does not want to

proceed with the said criminal case. Now the first
 201SKERITISS
(CHLM.C.2330115-B

petitioner and the first respondent are living
together as husband and wife and if the prosecution is
allowed to be continued, it will cause prejudice and
hardship to both parties and the same will affect
their future life.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,
the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel
for the first respondent.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioners urged
for quashing all criminal proceedings against the
petitioners under Annexure~A final report invoking
the jurisdiction and inherent power under Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned
counsel further cited the decision reported in Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)]. The
learned counsel for the first respondent also urged
for quashing the prosecution against the petitioners
invoking jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

4. I have meticulously considered the decision
 201SKERITISS
(CHLM.C.2330115-B

laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT
108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the
Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question
whether the High Court has power to quash criminal
proceedings involving non—compoundable offences on
the basis of the compromise reached between the
offender and the victim and answered as given below:

“87. ‘The position that emerges from the
above discussion can be summarised thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a
criminal proceeding or F.L.R. or complaint in
exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
distinct and different from the power given
to a criminal court for compounding the
offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent
power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
limitation but it has to be exercised in
accord with the guideline engrafted in such
power viz:(i) to secure the ends of justice or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court. In what cases power to quash the
criminal proceeding or complaint or F.LR.
may be exercised where the offender and
victim have settled their dispute would
depend on the facts and circumstances of
each case and no category can be prescribed.
However, before exercise of such power, the
High Court must have due regard to the
nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity. etc..
cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
victim or victim's family and the offender

 201SKERITISS
(CHLM.C.2330115-B

have settled the dispute. Such offences are
not private in nature and have serious
impact on society. Similarly, any
compromise between the victim and offender
in relation to the offences under special
statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act
or the offences committed by public
servants while working in that capacity etc:
cannot provide for any basis for quashing
criminal proceedings involving _ such
offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
flavour stand on different footing for the
purposes of quashing, particularly the
offences arising from commercial, financial,
mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
transactions or the offences arising out of
matrimony relating to dowry. etc.. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically
private or personal in nature and the parties
have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, High Court may quash
criminal proceedings if in its view. because
of the compromise between the offender and
victim, the possibility of conviction is
remote, bleak and continuation of criminal
case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
caused to him by not quashing the criminal
case despite full and complete settlement
and compromise with the victim. In other
words, the High Court must consider whether
it would be unfair or contrary to the
interest of justice to continue with the
criminal proceeding or continuation of the
criminal proceeding would tantamount to
abuse of process of law despite settlement
and compromise between the victim and
wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
justice, it is appropriate that criminal case
is put to an end and if the answer to the
above question(s) is in affirmative, the High

 201SKERITISS
(CHLM.C.2330115-B

Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
quash the criminal proceeding.”

5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the
question to be considered, in the instant case, is,
whether the non-compoundable offence involved in
this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the
inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Prima
facie, I find that the offences alleged against the
petitioners will not come under the category of non—
compoundable offences, which are specifically
excluded from composition, in the exercise of
inherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by
the affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is
seen that the dispute between the accused and the
victim had been amicably settled and at present the
de facto complainant has no subsisting grievance at
all. The de facto complainant does not want to
proceed with prosecution against the accused. Full
and final settlement and compromise with the victim

are evidenced by the affidavit filed by the first
 201SKERITISS
(CHLM.C.2330115-B

respondent. In view of the compromise between the
petitioners and the victim, I find that the possibility
of conviction is remote, bleak. and continuation of
the criminal case would put the parties to great
oppression, prejudice and also tantamount to abuse of
the process of the court. The present criminal
prosecution against the accused must be put to an end
to secure the interest of justice.

6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings
against the petitioners under Annexure~Al final
report will stand quashed in the exercise of
jurisdiction and power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

This petition is allowed.
