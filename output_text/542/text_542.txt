Crl. M.C No. 6269 of 2013

Dated this the 01" day of January, 2014.
ORDER

Petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 to 3 in O.R No.
7/99 of Nelliampathy Forest Range. The offences alleged are
punishable under Sections 27(1)(e)(iii) and (iv) of Kerala
Forest Act. The Cri.M.C is filed seeking to quash Annexure-A
charge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10 on the file
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur.
2. There are 12 accused in the crime. Accused Nos.
10 to 12 were acquitted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Alathur vide judgment dated 30.03.2007 in C.C No.
742/01. Subsequently, the accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8 faced the
trial and were acquitted in C.C.No.191/07 on the file of the
same court. It is submitted that out of the remaining accused,
two of them are no more and one is in abroad. The learned
Magistrate decided the case on merits vide Annexure-B and C
judgments. The learned Magistrate observes that he is unable
to accept the version of complainant that P7 statement was
given by A11 voluntarily and in the manner deposed by him
and complainant's witnesses, It is stated that there is no
evidence to prove the alleged commission of tresspass into the

forest area and removal of Rose wood timber by accused Nos.

10 to 12. The statement of accused No.10 which inculpates
the accused was not admitted in evidence. For these reasons,
the court found that A10 to 12 are not guilty of the offences
charged against them. In Annexure-B judgment, the court
observes that the accused except 10 to 12 are implicated as
per confession of accused No.10. The learned Magistrate
found that the confession is not admissible in evidence. For
the same reason, the learned Magistrate in Annexure-C
judgment found that there no other source to proceed against
accused Nos. 5,7 and 8 and that confession of accused No.10
is not binding on accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8. In the light of
Annexure-B and C judgment, the offences alleged against the
petitioners are liable to be quashed. Since the other accused
were acquitted, for the very same set of reasons, this Court is
of the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the
prosecution against the petitioner.

Accordingly, Cri.M.C is disposed of quashing
Annexure-A charge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,

Alathur.

HARUN-UL-RASHID, JUDGE.
