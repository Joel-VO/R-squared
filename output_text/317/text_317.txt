‘A Trust is proceeded against for non-payment of ESI

accused, he is the Chairman of the Trust and he is not
performing the day-to-day affairs of the trust. It is for the
petitioner to apprise the court below with regard to the true
state of affairs regarding the Trust.

Without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to take

up all these contentions before the court below, this Cri.M.C.

 201

(CRL.M.C.No. 2503 of 2017

is disposed of. As far as practicable, the court below shall

grant exemption to the petitioner from personal appearance.
