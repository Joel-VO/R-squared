THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON

 cel.me.me.$243 oF 2020(8) 20217KERSS

ORDER

The accused No.2 came up against the Annexure
A4 order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C partly
allowing release of certain articles seized from
her. The gold ornaments and the cash comes to
Rs.1,08,940/- (Rupees one lakh eight thousand nine
hundred and forty only) were not released by the
learned Magistrate. Aggrieved by the said order,

accused No.2 came up under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

2. The allegation levelled against both the
accused Nos. 1 and 2 prima facie appears to be very
serious as there is involvement of seventeen
persons and an amount of Rs.39,00,000/- (Rupees
thirty nine lakhs only) received under the guise of
promise to sell the property owned by somebody
else. It is submitted that, accused No.1 in fact
is doing a business of real estate, for which, he
used to enter into agreement with owners of the
property, but no such agreement is produced.

Accused No.2 is a lady. ‘The allegation levelled
 cri.MC.€o.5243 oF 20208) 20217KERSS

3

against accused No.2 is that, she is also a
participant, and received the amount on various
occasions under the guise of promise to give the
property. An order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C
is an interim order and always would stand subject
to an order, that may be passed under Section 452
Cr.P.c. Certain articles were released by the
learned Magistrate and some other articles which
includes gold ornaments and the amount retained on
sufficient reason. As such, there is no ground for
exhausting the inherent power under Section 482

cr.P.c.

‘The Crl.M.C. is hereby dismissed.
