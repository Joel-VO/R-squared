Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

2. Accused in Crime No.730/2013 of Badiadka Police
Station, pending as C.M.P.No.7810 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod are the petitioners. The

petition is filed seeking to quash further proceedings against the

petitioners in C.M.P.No.7810 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod.

3. The offence alleged is punishable under Section 498 A
