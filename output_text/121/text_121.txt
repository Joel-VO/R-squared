Cri.M.C.No.106 of 2018
Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in
CC.No.501/2013 of Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-II, Haripad arising from Crime No.519/2012 of
Haripad Police Station for offences punishable under
section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

2. According to the petitioner herein, he was
granted bail by this court and accordingly he had
appeared before the court below and was enlarged on
bail. The matter was referred for Adalath. In the
meanwhile, the petitioner went abroad. The mediation
had failed. Since he did not appear before the court
below, non bailable warrant was issued. Since his
presence could not be procured, the case was consigned
to the LP register and is now pending as LP.No.30/2015.

3. The petitioner herein contends that the

petitioner is willing to appear before the court below and

Crl.M.C.No.106 of 2018

2
to participate in all further proceedings by his personal
attendance or through his counsel. The only
apprehension of the petitioner herein is that, since non
bailable warrant was ordered, and the case considered
the LP register, there is a possibility that the bail
application proposed to be filed by him is not likely to be
taken up on the same day and he may be remanded.

4. Having considered the explanation offered
that the petitioner herein was abroad and also
considering the nature of allegations which is only one
under section 498A, arising from a matrimonial dispute,
T feel that the request made by the petitioner herein is
reasonable and can be granted. Essentially, the non
bailable warrant is issued to procure the presence of the
accused and if once it is ensured, there is no reason as
to why he should be remanded. Having considered
these facts, I am inc lied to dispose of the Cri.M.C with a
direction that the petitioner herein shall appear before
the court below within a period of ten days from today

and file appropriate applications for recalling the warrant
 Crl.M.C.No.106 of 2018

and also for bail. He shall deposit a sum of Rs.5000/-
towards the portion of the bond amount before the court
below. If the above conditions are satisfied, the court
below shall take up the applications to be filed by the
petitioner herein, on the same day of his appearance
itself and pass appropriate orders on the same day
having regard to what is stated above. The warrant
issued by the court below will be kept in abeyance till
his actual date of appearance within the above ten days.

Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.
