Crl.M.C.No.6773 of 2016

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 4 and 6 to 14 in

C.C.No.78/2016 of the Ju

ial First Class Magistrate's Court,
Koyilandy for the offences under Section 500 read with 34 IPC.

2. The 2" respondent preferred a private complaint
before the court below alleging the offence punishable under
Section 500 IPC read with 34 IPC against the 1" petitioner
Nazeera aged 22 years and 13 other persons, who are her
relatives.

3. There was a marriage proposal by the 2™
respondent to the 1" petitioner herein. Discussions were made
and the marriage was fixed. Wedding cards were printed.
Subsequently, prior to the marriage, the father and mother of
the 1" petitioner met with an accident and died on the spot.

4. The other relatives of the 1* petitioner were not
favouring the marriage of the 1° petitioner with the 2%
respondent. A meeting was arranged by the parties before the

‘Khasi’. In the presence of the ‘Khasi’, it seems that the
 2018KERIS

(CrL.M.C.N0.6773 of 2016 2
relatives of the 1" petitioner divulged the reason for which
they wanted to withdraw the proposal. It is alleged that they
had told the ‘Khasi’ that the 2° respondent is a drunkard and
‘a drug addict. According to the 2™ respondent, through the
said words the accused have defamed him.

5. It seems that it was in a private meeting arranged
by the parties in the presence of the ‘Khasi’, the accused were
forced to divulge the reason as to why they wanted to
withdraw from the marriage proposal. At any stretch of
imagination, it will not invite an offence under Section 500 IPC.
Therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.78/2016 are liable
to be quashed.

In the result, all further proceedings in C.C.No.78/2016

are quashed. It is made clear that this order will not stand in

the way of the 2 respondent to proceed with civil proceedi

against the accused, in case such proceedings will lie.
