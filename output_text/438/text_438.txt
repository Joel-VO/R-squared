ORDER.

1.The petitioner is the 1* accused in C.C.Nos. 587 of 2011
and 1035 of 2015 of the Judicial Magistrate of 1 Class,
Thaliparamba. He is proceeded against for having
committed offences punishable under Section 420 read
with Section 34 of the IPC.

2.The prosecution allegation in these cases is that the
petitioner was running a travel agency in the name and
style as 'Style Starlime Travels' and he offered Visa to
respective de facto complainants after accepting money
from them. He failed to issue Visa as assured which
resulted in the registration of crimes against him. The
petitioner was enlarged on bail as per order dated
23.9.2015 subject to stringent conditions.

3.The petitioner is aggrieved by condition No.2 in the bail

order which is extracted below for easy reference:
 2016KERI674

CrI.M.C, Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -2-

"2. He shall appear before the court on all
posting dates, on the failure of which the bail
bond shall stand automatically cancelled.”

4.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the
learned Public Prosecutor.

5.It is submitted by the learned counsel that imposing such
onerous condition is unconscionable. He is facing
allegations in 9 cases and has been complying with the
above condition without fail. Insisting upon him to appear
before Court on routine postings and the condition that on
his failure to appear even on a single day, the bail would
stand automatically cancelled is a condition which is
opposed to the basic tenets of a fair trial, is the

submission of the learned Counsel. The pet

ner is to
ritualistically appear before the learned Magistrate in all
the cases in which he is roped in as an accused even if no
effective proceeding is scheduled to take place before
Court on that particular day. The bail order was passed a
year back and it is prayed that necessary orders be

passed modifying the said condition.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions supported
the order passed by the learned Magistrate and submitted
that there is no need for interference at this stage.

7.Having bestowed my anxious considerations to the rival
submissions and after going through the impugned order,
I am of the firm view that the petitioner has made out a
case for interference. The learned Magistrate, after having
found that the petitioner was entitled to bail, imposed
adequate conditions to secure his presence before Court.
In view of the above the court was not justified in
imposing a condition that even on the failure of the
petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate on a
single posting date, his bail would be automatically
cancelled. The petitioner is represented by a counsel all
through and on postings when no effective transactions
take place, he can always be represented by his lawyer.

8.Condition No 2 in Annexure 2 order will stand lifted.
Instead it is ordered that if for some unavoidable reason,

the petitioner is not able to appear before the learned
 aovaneRrniers

CHLM.C, Nos.4883 84885 of 2016 -4-
Magistrate, the learned Magistrate shall not insist for his
personal appearance and instead the petitioner shall be
permitted to appear through counsel, provided application
is filed seeking exemption for the day. All other
conditions shall remain as such. The learned Counsel
prays that the learned Magistrate be directed to post all
the cases together or on alternate days. The learned
Magistrate shall post the cases together or on alternate
days if it is not otherwise inconvenient for any reason.

The petitions are disposed off.
