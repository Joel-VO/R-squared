Cri.M.C. No.4279 of 2016

Dated this the 3" day of August, 2016

1.The 1* Petitioner is the owner of a lorry bearing Reg.No.
KL-40-D-8794. On 3.7.2016, the said vehicle was seized
by the 2% respondent on the allegation that the vehicle
was used for transporting ordinary earth, in violation to
the provisions under the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of
illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015
(hereinafter referred to as “the Transportation
Rules,2015”).

2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any
offence punishable under the said rules can be
compounded, either before or after the institution of the

prosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of
 2016KERI877

CrILM.C. No.4279 of 2016

the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,
1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules,
2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to
that offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the
Government, of such sum as that person may specify.
Referring to Annexure-A2, it is submitted that the 3°
respondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint
to the Court or to compound the offence.

3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicle has not
been produced before the 3” respondent till date. The
prayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2
respondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules,
2015 and to produce the vehicle seized before the 3"
respondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued
to the 3" respondent to provide an opportunity to the
petitioner to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the

Transportation Rules, 2015.

3

4.1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.

5.1 find considerable merit in the submission of the learned
counsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the
Transportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of
2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3" respondent
is the competent authority to prefer complaint before the
learned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of
the offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to
secure the ends of justice :-

i. The 2” respondent is directed to produce
the aforesaid vehicle involved in the offence
before the 3% respondent within a period of
two days from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order.

ii, The 3% respondent shall permit the
petitioners to compound the offence under Rule
32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible
under law.

iii, The above endeavour shall be completed

a

within a period of 5 days from the date of
receipt of this order.

If the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the
Transportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicle shall

be released forthwith. This petition is disposed off.
