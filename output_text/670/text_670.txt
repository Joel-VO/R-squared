Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281,
8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017

Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018,
ORDER

These Cri.M.Cs. arise from C.C. No.879/2012 of the
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram,
C.C. No.1033/2014, C.C, No.808/2012, FIR No.490/2014, C.C.
No.1917/2013, C.C, No.804/2014, 1119/2014, C.C. No.1228/2012
& C.C.1916/2013, all of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Thiruvalla.

2. Essentially, the disputes between the husband and
wife arising out of a matrimonial discord, have triggered the
above nine criminal cases. It seems that the matrimonial
relationship between the husband and wife ended in a failure,
leading to filing of a criminal complaint before the Chief Judicial
Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram alleging matrimonial
cruelty. This led to registration of C.C.No.879/2012 for offences
punishable under Sections 498A & 34 IPC. Other rival claims
between the parties are the subject matter of the other criminal
cases. Out of the above, 3 cases are instituted at the instance of

the mother-in-law of the wife and 3 by the wife. It seems that
 2018KERT2

Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017

there were other matrimonial proceedings pending before the
Family Courts.

3. Pending O.P. No.961/2012 of the Family Court
Thiruvalla, the disputes were settled and a compromise was filed
before that court as Annexure A2. Annexure A2 discloses that all
the disputes between the parties were amicably settled and the
parties resolved to give a quietus to the various criminal and
other proceedings pending between them. Paragraph 8 and 9 of
the above proceedings relate to the specific criminal cases
pending between the parties. The above settlement was
accepted by the Family Court and Annexure A3 judgment was
passed by the court, recording the settlement. It is stated that
the parties have thereafter resolved all other disputes and
separate orders were passed in the matrimonial proceedings.

4. CrlLM.Cs. are filed by the petitioners contending that in
the light of the settlement between the parties, no purpose will be
served by prosecuting the accused and the copy of the
‘compromise has been filed in each of the above case.

5. The learned Public Prosecutors on instructions

submitted that the statement of the respective de facto
 2018KERT2

Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017
3

complainants have been recorded in six cases and the Police were
informed about the settlement of the remaining three criminal
cases also. Both the counsel for the petitioners and the learned
counsel for the contesting respondents submitted that in the light
of the settlement between the parties evidenced by Annexure A2,
the respective de facto complainants do not propose to pursue
their respective criminal cases.

6. Having considered the rival claims, the fact that the
dispute between the parties arose from a matrimonial discord
which has now been settled amicably and that all other
matrimonial proceedings have been brought to its logical
conclusion, | feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting
the accused, The law is settled that in matrimonial disputes, the
court shall accept the settlement between the parties and shall
give quietus to the criminal cases arising from matrimonial
disputes. Hence, | feel that no purpose will be served by
prosecuting the respective accused and the criminal cases are
liable to be brought to an end.

Accordingly, Cri.M.Cs. are allowed. All further proceedings in
