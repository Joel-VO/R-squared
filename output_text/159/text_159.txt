Crl.M.C No.163 of 2015

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the registered owner of the Car
No.KL-01-AJ 1881. In Crime No.1120/2013 the Parasalla Police
seized the said vehicle and produced it in court. The petitioner herein
made a claim under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for
interim custody of the vehicle, and the respondents also made a rival
claim. The petitioner's claim was filed as C.M.P No.13731/2014 and
the respondents claim was filed as C.M.P No.13732/2014.

2. After hearing both sides, the learned Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court II, Neyyattinkara allowed the petitioner's
application on certain conditions, and further directed that in case the
petitioner failed to comply with the conditions, the vehicle will be
released to the respondent. That particular part of the order making
an alternative option for release of the vehicle under Section 451 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure is under challenge. Practically the
order is in favour of the petitioner, and of course he will have to
comply with some conditions. It is not known whether the respondent

has brought proceeding, challenging the said order. In fact the
 2019KERII263

AAMC No.t69 of 2015 2
respondent cannot be said to be a beneficiary of the said order
because she will get the vehicle, even if such order could be enforced,
only when the petitioner failed to comply with the conditions. When
the court makes an order under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, for interim custody of a property, the order must be
definite and it must be in favour of the person who has right to posses
the property, either subject to final decision under Section 452 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, or subject to decision by a competent
civil court. Here it is submitted that a civil case is pending. So final
decision will have to be taken by the civil court. No doubt, the
petitioner will have the right to possess the vehicle as the registered
owner of the vehicle, If so, the court below, exercising the powers
under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cannot direct
release of the vehicle to somebody else once it is found that the
petitioner is the right person to possess the vehicle. If he wants the

vehicle he will definitely comply with the conditions. If he doesn't

comply with the conditions the vehicle will continue in court custody,
I find that the second part of the order under challenge is liable to be
set aside, and the vehicle will have to be released to the petitioner, on
‘compliance of the conditions.

3. The petitioner is also aggrieved by one of the

conditions, directing him to deposit %6 lakhs before the court. It is not
 2019KERII263

AAMC No.t69 of 2015 3
known why such a condition is imposed by the court below.
Admittedly, the petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle and
the respondent claims possession on the contention that some money
was advanced by her to purchase the vehicle. This is a matter to be
looked and decided by the civil court, As the registered owner the
petitioner has every right to possess the vehicle without being
questioned by anybody. The other conditions imposed by the court
below will serve the purpose in the present circumstances. It would
be unjust and inappropriate to direct deposit of 86 lakhs as a condition
for getting custody of the vehicle. In the result, this Criminal
Miscellaneous Case is allowed, as follows:
i) The second condition imposed by the court
below directing deposit of 66 lakhs will stand set aside.
i) The second part of the impugned order
directing release of the vehicle to the respondent in case the
petitioner failed to comply with the directions, will also stand

set aside.
