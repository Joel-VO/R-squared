Cri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015

Dated this the 5'
ORDER
The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.18/2014 on

® day of January, 2018

the files of the court below. The above case arose out of a
private complaint filed by the first respondent herein
before the court below against the petitioner alleging
offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act

2, The case was originally pending as.
S.T.No.21/2010 before the court below. However,
thereafter, the case was converted as C.C.No.18/2014 by
the court below. The court below also ordered denova
trial on the ground that a part of the evidence was
recorded by the predecessor of the presiding officer of the
court below.

3. The petitioner filed C.M.P.No.62/2014 before the
court below praying for sending Ext.P1 cheque for expert

opinion for ascertaining as to whether the signature, date,
 2018KERATO
Cri, M.C. No.2880 of 2015

name and amount in Ext.P1 were authorised by a single
person or not. The court below as per Annexure-G order
dated 4.2.2015 dismissed the said C.M.P., against which
this Crl.M.C. has been filed.

4. Heard both sides.

5. The petitioner earlier filed C.M.P.No.8/2011,
praying for sending Ext.P1 cheque for forensic
examination of the handing. Even though the said
application was allowed initially, the same was
subsequently dismissed on the reason that the petitioner
did not produce specimen signature. Thereafter, the
petitioner filed C.M.P.No.60/2011 for sending Ext.P1
cheque and Ext.P8 letter for expert opinion. The court
below allowed the prayer in respect of Ext.P8 letter.
However, the court below turned down the prayer with
regard to Ext.P1 cheque. Thereafter, the petitioner filed

the present petition.
 2018KERATO
Cri, M.C. No.2880 of 2015

6. | have gone through the evidence of PW1. PW1
stated that Ext.P1 was filled up before bringing the same
to the complainant and thereafter, the accused put the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque in the presence of PW1. The
evidence of PW1 is clear that PW1 did not see the accused
or any other person filling up the cheque, What PW1 had
seen was only affixing the signature in the cheque by the
accused. In view of the above evidence of PW1, no
purpose will be served even if the present petition is
allowed. In the said circumstances, there is no meaning in
ascertaining as to whether the signature, date, name and
amount in Ext.P1 were written by the same person or not.
For the said reason, | am not inclined to set aside the
order impugned. Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. stands
dismissed.

However, | make it clear that if Ext.P8 is not yet sent
for expert opinion as per the order of the court below in

C.M.P.No.60/2011 in S.T.No.21/2010, the petitioner shall
 2018KERATO
Cri, M.C. No.2880 of 2015

be at liberty to file fresh application before the court

below for the same.
