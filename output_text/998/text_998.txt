This case having been finally heard today, the court today delivered the
following:-
JUDGMENT
1. This case has arisen on a final report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,
of

‘Thampanoor Police station in crime No, 346/10 alleging the commis
an offences against the accused under Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian
Penal Code.

2. The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows: On 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am
the accused nos. 1 and 2 in furtherance of common intention to cause
voluntarily hurt to the informant who was working as the receptionist in
‘Thycaud Govt. hospital , accused nos. 1 and 2 attacked the informant by
‘wrongfully restrain him. The 1" accused beaten on his backside and fisted on
his face. By the attack of 1* accused dislocation caused to his left tooth. The
2 accused beaten on his body and voluntarily caused hurt to him. When 2
and 3% witness in the final report tried to prevent it, they were brutally
‘manhandled by 2! accused in this case and the 3" accused also participated in
the commission of offence. Thus the accused nos. 1 and 2 alleged to have
committed the offences under Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal
Code.

3. On the issuance of summons, the accused no, 1 and 2 appeared before the
court, The accused were furnished with copies of prosecution records and
 3
thereby complied with the mandate under section 207 of the Criminal

Procedure Code. Thereafter, the accused were heard on the charge levelled
against him. The charge was framed under Section 323, 332 r/w 34 of the In-
dian Penal Code, read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the si

of the prosecution, the prosecution examined seven
PW1 to PW7 and marked eight documents as Exts. P1 to P8, P8(a),P8(b) and
PB(c).No defence evidence was adduced from the side of the defence.

5. On the completion of prosecution evidence, the accused no. 1 and 2 were
questioned under Section 313 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in which
they denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing in prosecution

tmesses as

evidence against them.

6. Heard the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the
accused.

7. The points that arise for consideration are as follows:-
1: Did the accused on 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am the accused nos. 1 and 2
‘in furtherance of common intention attack and to cause voluntarily
hurt to the informant who was working as the receptionist in Thy-
caud Govt. hospital and thus alleged to have committed under Section
323 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code?

2. Did the accused on 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am the accused nos. 1 and 2
in furtherance of common intention attack and prevent witness nos. 1
to 3 inthe final report from discharging his official duty and thus al-
leged to have committed under Section 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal
Code?

3 Ifthe accused are found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?

8. Point Noland 2_:- In this case, PW4 deposed before the court that on
05.05.2010 while he had been working as Sub Inspector of Thampanoor
police station he got knowledge regarding the commission of offence from
 10,

a.

4

witness no. 1 in the final report, Based on that information had regis

crime against accused nos. 1 and 2 vide Thampanoor police station crime
346/2010 w/s. 323, 332 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code, During the
course of investigation he had identified 1" and 2™ accused and continued
with the investigation. After completing the investigation PW4 filed final re-
port in this case.

PW6 deposed before the court that on 05.05.2010 while he had been working,
as casualty medical officer, he had examined witness no. 1 in the final report
and prepared Ext P7 medical certificate.

PW7 deposed before the court that he went to Thycaud Govt. Hospital as per
the direction of witness no. 9 in the final report and prepared the body note by
verifying the body of witness no. 5 in the final report.

I have analysed the evidence of PW4, PW6 and PW7 In this case, from the
side of prosecution PW1 to 7 were examined. But PW1,PW2,PW3 and PWS
‘were turned hostile to the prosecution. Even though the witnesses were turned
hostile to the prosecution learned Assistant Public Prosecutor continued to

proceed with the examination of remaining witnesses on the ground that it is

an offence affecting the interest of public at large and if the remaining
witnesses were given up by the prosecution it would adversely affect the
prosecution and administration of justice in this case. Hence the learned

Assistant Public Prosecutor continued with the proceed with the case.

2. It is pertinent to note that there is no delay in lodging the FIR. I have analysed

the evidence of PW1 he had deposed about the incident but could not identi-
fied the accused. ‘The same deposition was given by other injured who were
‘examined as PW2 and PW3. In this case, the offences alleged against the ac-
cused is w/s. 323 and 332 riw 34 of the Indian Penal Code. On analysing the
evidence of Ext PS wound certificate PWG noticed about the injuries are small
abrasion and contusion and dislocation of left lower second premolar tooth.
But PW6 deposed the injuries before this court but the prosecution has not
brought out from the evidence of PWG about the opinion as to the cause of
injury. So the medical evidence is not supporting the prosecution case to the
 5
extent that does not corroborate with the evidence of other prosecution

‘witnesses regarding the opinion as to the cause of injury.

13, In order to constitute an offence ws. 332 and 323 of Indian Penal Code it
‘must be proved by the prosecution that the witnesses who are the public ser-
vants performed their duty and they were injured by discharging their official
uty. 2 thing is that the act must be done with the intend to prevent the pub-
lic servants from discharging their official duties. In this case, nothing has
been revealed from the prosecution case regarding whether in voluntarily hurt
‘was caused to witness no. 1 to3 in the final report which prevent them from
discharging their official duty at the time of incident. Moreover, the prosecu-
tion has failed to produce relevant records showing that witness no. 1 to 3 in
the final report are public servants of Govt. Hospital, Thycaud and they were
performed duty at the time of alleged incident. Hence prosecution has failed
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused nos. 1 and 2 on 05.05.2010 at
09.30 am went to Thycaud hospital, Thiruvananthapuram and attacked wit-

ness no. 1 to 3 in the final report and voluntarily caused hurt to them and pre-

vent them from discharging their official duty. Hence, point nos. 1 and 2 are
found against the prosecution.

10. Point No, 3:- In view of my findings on Point No.1 and 2, itis found that the
accused no. 1 and 2 are found not guilty of the offences punishable under
Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

11 In the result, the accused no, 1 and 2 are found not guilty and acquitted under
Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offence under
Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The bail bonds of the
accused stand cancelled and they are set at liberty. No property was produced
in this case,
