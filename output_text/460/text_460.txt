ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.194 of 2016
registered at the Vengara Police Station for the offence
punishable under Sections 341, 323, 506(i), 308 r/w 34 of IPC,
now pending as S.C.No.127 of 2019 on the files of Additional
District and Sessions Court-III, Manjeri. The de facto complainant
at whose instance the crime was registered is the 1* respondent.
‘Annexure A2 affidavit has been filed by the 1% respondent,
stating that the dispute has been settled and that he has no
subsisting grievance against the petitioner.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on
instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal
antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,
nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed
by the 1 respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be
true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
that no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in

view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings
 2nuKERI.OL

ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and
hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab
[(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and
another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in
granting the relief sought.

4, In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in
S.C.No.127 of 2019 on the files of Additional District and
Sessions Court-III, Manjeri is quashed.
