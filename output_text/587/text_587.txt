THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Cr1.MC.No.7120 OF 2019(H) 2

ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2020

Petitioner is the 4" accused in S.C No.98/2017 on the
files of the Additional Sessions Court-II, Manjeri for having
allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 341,
324, 302 and 201 r/w Section 34 of IPC along with some other
accused.

2. The petitioner was permitted to go abroad for a
period of two years and his passport was released, thereafter
he sought extension of further period of six months which also
was allowed, but on expiry of that further period of six
months, he did not surrender and his prayer for further
extension of six months was disallowed by the court vide
Annexure A order. Thereafter, the petitioner surrendered his
passport and sought further time of six months to go abroad
which was disallowed by the court vide Annexure B order on
the ground that he committed default of not surrendering his
passport after the extended period of six months. The co-

accused have been allowed to go abroad vide Annexure C and
 Cr1.MC.No.7120 OF 2019(H) 3 2m0KEKne

D orders. The petitioner submitted that he is employed
abroad and his not reaching there on time will result in loosing
of his employment and that the rules pertains to employment
is very strict in Saudi Arabia, where he is employed. The
petitioner did not appear on time, but nevertheless,
subsequently surrendered his passport. It is also pertinent to
note that he had applied for an extension of time, when he
could not appear within the stipulated time, but that was
disallowed by the court. The non-appearance of the
petitioner does not appears to be a wanton act of breach.
Considering the fact that the trial has not yet began, I
am of the opinion that the petitioner can be permitted to go
abroad for a further period of four months on certain stringent

conditions. He

directed to deposit a sum of Rs.one lakh
before the trial court and in case he fails to appear before the
stipulated time of four months, the said amount shall be
forfeited. On these conditions, the passport of the petitioner
shall be released for a period of four months from the date of

release of the passport.
