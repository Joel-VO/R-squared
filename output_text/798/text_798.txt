THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION
ON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE
FOLLOWING:
 Crl.MC.No.9266 OF 201916)

2

)RDER
Dated this the 7th day of January 2020

The petitioner is the first accused in
Crime No.659/2014 of Guruvayur Police Station,
for having allegedly committed offences
punishable under Sections 406, 417, 418, 420
x/w Section 34 of the IPC along with other
accused. The case against the petitioner is now
pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Chavakkad as CC No.1522/2014.

2. The facts in brief is that, the
petitioner is a Managing Director of the
Santhimadom Builders and Developers Trust,
North Paravur and he had undertaken
construction of some villas in Kottappadi.
Even though the construction work has been
completed, the disputes arose with respect to
the expenses incurred and other incidental

works. The petitioner has a lot of defence to
 Cel.MC.No.9266 OF 201916)

3
make on the ground that due to recent amendment
in the Archeology Department, the work could
not be completed as decided. Several cases are
pending against the petitioner admittedly.

3. Under the circumstances, I do not find
any ground whatsoever to quash the proceedings
pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Chavakkad. There is also civil
dispute pending. Argument of the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner is that,
the dispute has to be resolved by a civil court
is not acceptable because the mere fact that,
there is a civil dispute will not automatically
absolve the petitioner's criminal liabilities.
It is therefore, not possible to consider this
application to quash the proceedings. The
petitioner is directed to appear before the

Jurisdictional Magistrate and face trial.

The learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that, he may be permitted to get
exemption from personal appearance. It is for
the Magistrate to decide the same on

application being filed by the petitioner.

With these observation the Crl.M.c is

disposed of.
