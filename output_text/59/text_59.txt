SUNIL THOMAS, 3.

Crl.M.C.No.45 of 2017

Dated this the 4” day of January, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime
No.27/14 of Puthencruz Police Station for offences
punishable under Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian
Penal Code. After investigation final report was laid and
the matter is pending as CC.No.1504/2014 of Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry.

2. The petitioner submits that the warrant was
issued by the court below at the first instance itself.
According to the petitioner herein, he was employed and
was regularly attending the office. He never absconded
and he never had any intention to keep away from the
jurisdiction of the court below. The petitioner now
submits that he is ready and willing to appear before the
court below and participate in the trial. However his only

apprehension is that in the event of his surrender before
 217KERRI9

CH.M.C.No.45 of 2017

the court below, the court below is not likely to take up

his bail application on the same day and there is a

possibility that he will be remanded.

3. Notice was given to the learned Public
Prosecutor and heard the learned counsel for the
petitioner.

4. The offences alleged against the petitioner are
under Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code. It
seems that the final report was laid some time in 2014
and the matter has been pending since then. In the light
of the submission of the petitioner that he is ready and
willing to participate in the proceedings, virtually the
purpose of issuing the summons stand served. Hence I
feel that relief can be granted to the petitioner herein.

Hence this Crl.M.C is disposed of with a direction
that in the event of the petitioner herein appearing before
the court below within ten days from today and
submitting himself to the jurisdiction, his bail application

may be considered by the court below on the same day,

having regard to the above said facts. The warrant issued
 217KERRI9

CH.M.C.No.45 of 2017 3

by the court below will be kept in abeyance during the

above ten days period.
