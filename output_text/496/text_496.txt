ORDER

Dated this the Sth day of January 2021

This petition filed by the petitioners, who are the accused
Nos.1, 3 and 4 in C.C.No.741/2016 pending before the
Judicial First Class Magistrate -I, Alathur for a direction to the
court below to dispose of the case at an early date.

2. A report has been called for from the court
concerned regarding the present status of the case and the
time required for disposal of the same. The learned Judicial
First Class Magistrate-I, Alathur has reported that actually the
case stands posted to 08.02.2021 but it was suo motu
advanced to 04.01.2021 for examination of CW 1 to 3 and
therefore only six months time is required to dispose of the
same.

3. As the case is of the year 2016, I think that the time
sought for by the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate-I for

disposal of the same appears to be quite reasonable.

Hence, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of directing the learned
Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Alathur to dispose of

C.C.No.741/2016 within a period of six months from today.
