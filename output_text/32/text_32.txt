Crl.M.C. No.23/2014
2

On going through Annexure-lI affidavit, it is seen that
the parties have settled all their differences and issues
between them and no further grievance remains to be
resolved between the victim and the accused. It is pointed
out that the victim is disinterested in continuing the matter.
In the light of the statement made in the affidavit, it is felt
that continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise
in futility.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings in Crime No. 3128 of 2013 of Chalakkudy Police
Station including the FIR shall stand quashed and the
petitioner shall stand discharged and all further proceedings

shall stand dropped
