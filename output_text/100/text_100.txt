P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.86 of 2015

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner is the 2% accused in C.C
No.2485/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II,
Thrissur.

2. On the apprehension of arrest, and remand to
judicial custody, in execution of a warrant of arrest, and the
other steps issued from the trial court, the petitioner seeks
orders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
directing the court below to permit him to surrender, and to
consider his request for bail, without delay. He also seeks a
direction for expeditious disposal of C.C No.2485/2012. Of
course a direction for expeditious disposal of the case cannot be
now thought of. The petitioner can very well approach the
learned Magistrate and make such request. His request for bail
will have to be considered by the learned Magistrate, who has
issued warrant of arrest for proper and legal reasons. The
petitioner's request for a direction to the court below to recall

the warrant of arrest cannot now granted because that request
 201SKERI784

CCHLM.C No. 06 0f 2015 2
will have to be considered by the learned Magistrate. The
petitioner will have to surrender before the trial court and make
application for bail afresh. I do not think that the learned
Magistrate will mechanically remand him to judicial custody
without hearing him regarding his grievance and the explanation
for his absence. The learned Magistrate will have to consider
his explanation, and the question of granting him bail, on
appropriate conditions can be thought of.

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
closed with a direction to the court below that in case application
for bail is filed by the petitioner, on surrender in C.C
'No.2485/2012, the same shall be judiciously considered, and
appropriate orders shall be passed, on the date of surrender

itself, however with notice to the other side.
