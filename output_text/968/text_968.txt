This case having been finally heard on 23.01.2025 and this Court on
25.01.2025 delivered the following: -

JUDGMENT.
This is a caso instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of

Police, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 5575/2013 for the offences
punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’).

2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Accused was the driver of
the KSRTC bus bearing Registration No. TS-804. He drove the vehicle through
Palayam overbridge rashly, negligent and in a manner so as to endanger human
life and at high speed through about 9:45 pm on 18.09.2013 and hit on the
backside of the motorcycle bearing Registration No. KL 19 D 2564 which was
driven by the Informant, in the same direction. Due to its impact, the Informant
fell down on the road and sustained serious injury to his left side of head. Further
he also sustained fracture in his right leg and left ankle, injuries on his left
shoulder and elbow. Thus, the Accused is thereby alleged to have committed the

above stated offences,

3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279, 337

‘and 338 of the IPC and took the case on file. On issuance of process, the Accused
 3
entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of
his own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him.
‘The particulars of offence under Sections 279, 337, 338 of the IPC were read over
and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
‘Though the Accused did not turn up before this Court subsequently and steps
effected against him, he appeared thereafter with fresh solvent sureties and got
enlarged on bail,

4, From the side of Prosecution, CWs! and 2 were examined as PWs 1 and 2
respectively and Exhibit P1 marked, The remaining witnesses were given up by
the Learned APP as the material witnesses turned hostile to the case of
Prosecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of
the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC

was dispensed with, No Defence evidence was adduced,

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points

arise for consideration.

a. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a
‘manner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby
committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?

b. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle in the said manner and
caused hurt to PWI and thereby committed the offence punishable under

Section 337 IPC as alleged?
 4

¢. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in the manner
aforesaid caused grievous hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence

punishable under Section 338 of the IPC as alleged?

d, Ifo, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points a toe: These points are considered together for the sake of brevity

‘and to repetition.

PW deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred on
18.09.2013 near Secretariat. According to him, KSRTC Bus had hit on the
backside of his motor cycle while he was travelling in a bike. He deposed that he
‘gave Exhibit PI Statement to the police. However, he denied identification of the
Dus, the depo, the reason for the incident and further deposed that he had not seen
the person who allegedly drove the vehicle.

PW2 deposed that he lives in Neyyatinakara, He knows the PW1. The
incident took place in front of the Secretariat on 18.09.2013 by around 10:00PM
PW1 was riding @ bike in front of him. He was travelling from Kizhakkekotta to
Secretariat. One KSRTC bus hit on the backside of PW1's bike and PWI fell near
divider on the road,  PWI was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and he
followed the ambulance, He denied identification of the bus, the reason for the
incident and further the person who allegedly drove the vehicle. He also denied to
have given statement to the police to the effect that the incident occurred on

‘account of the negligence and carelessness of the driver of the bus.
 5

(On going through the evidence and the materials on record, itis pertinent to
note that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no
case that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused. In fact,
PWI categorically deposed that he does not know the Accused and has no case
that it was the Accused who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the
Prosecution so as to implicate him. PW2, one of the occurrence witnesses also
denied having witnessed the incident and turned hostile to the Prosecution. The
remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as the material witnesses
had turned hostile to the Prosecution and also no purpose would be served in
examining the remaining witnesses in the said circumstance. Thus, there is
nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the witnesses so as to
implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused by the aforesaid
acts committed the above offences, having caused PW1 to sustain injuries. The
Prosecution has thus failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence
and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Hence these points are found in favour of the Accused.

9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found
in favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.

10, Im the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offence under section 255(1) of
‘CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.
