BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.436 of 2024

Dated this the 18 day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner challenges the order dated 08.12.2023 in Cri.M.P.No.4085
of 2023 in C.C.No.991 of 2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court, Ambalapuzha. According to the petitioner, an
application filed under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking to cross-examine
PW2 was rejected by the learned Magistrate. The reason for filing such
application was on account of the fact that petitioner’s counsel could not
cross-examine the witness on the date fixed since the counsel was
suffering from throat pain.

2. T have heard Sri.C.R.Sanish, the learned counsel for the
petitioner as well as Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor.

3. In the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has specifically
mentioned the various dates to which the case was adjourned for cross-
examination of the witness. However, on alll those occasions, for some

sd out and on

reason or the other, cross-examination was not car
25.08.2023, when the witness appeared for cross-examination, the
counsel was not ready due to throat pain. The learned Magistrate after
noticing that the application for adjournment did not specify the actual
date on which the counsel was suffering from throat pain, refused to rely

upon the said application and declined to recall the witness.

4. On a consideration of the contentions advanced by the learned
counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor and on
a perusal of the impugned order, this Court is of the opinion that even
though the reasons given by the learned Magistrate cannot be found fault
with considering the circumstance that PW2 has not been cross-
examined, in order to enable a fair trial to be carried out, one more
opportunity can be granted to the petitioner to cross-examine the
witness. The inability to cross-examine a witness due to an illness of the
counsel for a party cannot be a reason to recall a witness, as alternative
measures ought to have been adopted by the party as well as the
counsel, especially since repeated postings had been given by the learned
Magistrate in the instant case.

5. However, adopting 2 lenient view, this Court sets aside the
impugned order and direct the learned Magistrate to recall PW2 in
C.C.No.991 of 2019 on a date convenient to the court as a last
opportunity. If on the said date so fixed by the learned Magistrate,
petitioner fails to cross-examine the witness, necessarily further such
opportunities need not be granted.

With the above observation, this Cri.M.C.is allowed setting aside the
impugned order dated 08.12.2023.
