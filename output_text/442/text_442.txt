Cri. M. C. No. 4901 of 2016

Dated this the 3” day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime
No.1863/2016 of Adoor Police Station for offences punishable
under Sections 452, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of IPC read with
Sections 3(1)(s), 3(1),(wii), 3(2) (VA) of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities), Amendment Act,
2015.

2. The allegation of the defacto complainant is that, the
petitioner herein had assaulted her. According to the learned
counsel for the petitioner, actually there was a monetary dispute
between the wife of the petitioner and the defacto complainant
which promoted the defacto complainant to set up a false case.
Even in the Fi statement, there is a reference about a monetary
transaction. The learned counsel submits that, he is ready and
willing to surrender before the court below. However, his
apprehension is that, the bail application submitted by him is not
likely to be taken up on the same day.

Having regard to the limited prayer sought for by him, this

CrILM.C. is disposed of with a direction that in the event of the
 2016KERI33890

(Cri. M, C. No, 4901 of 2016

petitioner surrendering before the court below and files an
application for bail, the same shall be considered by the court
below on the same day, having regard to the spirit of the
decisions reported in Shanu V. State of Kerala (2000 (3) KLT
452) and Ali V. State of Kerala (2000 (2) KLT 280) and also
the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

present case only an offshoot of a monetary dispute.
