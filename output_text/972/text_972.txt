‘This case finally came up for consideration and hearing on 18.02.2025 and
this Court on the 20.02.2025 delivered the following:
JUDGMENT

1 ‘This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector
of Police, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 904/2015 for the offences
punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 and 34 of the IPC of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.

2. ‘The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the animosity
towards the Informant, in attempting to resist the Accused persons volunatarily
causing hurt to CWs 2 and 3, in connection with the residence association
programme, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention of the
Accused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to the Informant, on 23.08.2015 at 05:45
PM, near Jagathi Auditorium at Powdikkonam, uttered obscene words against the
Informant and the 1" Accused pushed the Informant from behind, The 2" Accused.
‘kicked on the right shoulders of the Informant and caused her to sust
‘on her legs on account of her having fallen down. They further assaulted CWs 4
‘and 5 who attempted to resist them. Thereby the Accused persons are alleged to
have committed the above mentioned offences,

contusion
 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the
offences under Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC. The ingredients of Section
294(b) were found to be not made out. On issuance of process, the Accused
Persons entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on bail. They
‘were represented by a Counsel of thelr own choice. The 2" Accused was reported
to be no more and copy of his death certificate also produced. Copies of all
relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them, After hearing both parties
and on perusing relevant records, charge was framed for the offences punishable
under Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC , 1860 and the same was read over
‘and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution CWsi, 4, 5 and 9 were examined as PWs1 to 4
respectively and Exhibits P1 to P3 marked. The presence of CWs 2 and 3 could not
bbe procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been executed against him,
‘The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material
witness, the injured themselves had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution.
‘Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses,
the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed
with. No Defence evidence was also adduced.

5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for
consideration:

(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable
under Section 323 of the IPC as alleged?

(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
voluntarily caused grevious hurt to PWI and thereby committed offence
punishable under Section 325 of the IPC as alleged?
 4

(©) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,
assaulted or used criminal force on PW1 and thereby outraged her modesty
under Section 354 of the IPC as alleged?

(@) If 30, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?

6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and for avoiding repetition.

PWI deposed that had sustained injury in this incident. CWs 2 and 3 are her
nephews and they also sustained injury in the incident and that she gave Exhibit
P1 statement to the police regarding the incident. She however denied the Accused
persons having assaulted her or other witnesses in any manner as alleged. She
further deposed on specific question put forth by the Learned APP that the matters
have been settled between the parties and they entered into compromise
voluntarily and the Exhibit P2 is the Compromise Petition so filed by her.

PW2 also went against the case of Prosecution and denied having been
assaulted in the alleged incident. He further denied to have given statement to that
effect and to the effect that he witnessed other injured having been assaulted as
‘well to the police. PWS also deposed in the same line.

PW4 is the Investigating Officer and he deposed that he recorded Exhibit P1
and Exhibit P1(a) body note of the PW1 and that accordingly he registered Exhibit
P3 FIR.

(On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on
record, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 and the other witnesses that there is
no evidence to support the Prosecution case, In fact, PW1 has no case that it was
the Accused persons who had allegedly committed the aforesaid offences. The
other injured and occurrence witnesses also deposed against the version of the
Prosecution. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are seen to be
established by the Prosecution. There is no whisper that that it was the Accused
 persons who had allegedly assaulted the injured witnesses. CWs2 and 3 did not
‘even turn up before this Court, In the aforesaid circumstances, the remaining
witness was given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in
examining him in the above circumstances. Neither the ingredients of the alleged
offences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons brought out in the evidence
adduced by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution
has miserably failed to prove the involvement of this Accused persons in the above
Crime beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, this Court finds that the Prosecution has
failed to prove the case against the Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are
found in favour of the Accused.

7. Point (a); In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not
arise for consideration.

8 Inthe result, the 1" Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offences punishable under Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 IPC. He is acquitted of
the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands
cancelled and he is set at liberty. Since the 2 Accused is reported to be no more,
the charge against him is abated.
