SUNIL THOMAS, J.
Cri. M, C. No. 5307 of 2017

Dated this the 6 day of December, 2017
ORDER
‘The petitioners herein challenged Annexures Al & A4 FIRS

and Annexure AS

!al report laid in the above FIRs. The crux of
the allegation of the 3” respondent herein was that, on
02.04.2014 at about 2.30 p.m., the accused assaulted the 3°

respondent herein and her family members and caused bodily

injuries. It was alleged that with the intention of humiliating and
downgrading her and outraging her modesty, being a member of
a scheduled caste, the petitioners uttered abusive words and
committed overt acts. She laid FIS which was registered as FIR
No.15/2014 evidenced by Anneuxre 1 for offences punishable
under Sections 323, 354 read with Section 34 of IPC.
Subsequently, she along with her husband and son filed Annexure
3 petition before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1,
Changanacherry alleging that though various offences were made
‘out and complaint was laid to the Police, they after registering a
crime did not conduct an effective investigation. It was also
alleged that the main offence under SC/ST (POA) Act were not

incorporated in the FIR. Invoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.
 2017KERIISS
Cri. M, C. No, $307 of 2017

Annexure 3 was referred to the Police, who after registering
Annexure 4 FIR No.504/2014 for offences punishable under
Sections 141, 149, 294(a),(b), 323, 324, 354, 441 of IPC and
Sections 3(1)(x)(xi) and (xv), 3(2)(VII) 4 of SC/ST POA Act,
investigated into the allegations. Later, finding that the place of
incident and the subject matter involved in both the FIS were the
same, they were clubbed together and report was given to the
court. After completion of investigation final report was laid as
Annexure 5.

2. The petitioners, contending that two FIRs in relation to
the same incident is impermissible, that the leamed Magistrate,
even after being informed about the registration of crime went on
invoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and ought to have invoked the
provision under Section 210 Cr.P.C. and further that on merits the
offence under SC/ST (POA) Act was not made out, sought to quash
both the FIS and the final report. Learned counsel for the
petitioners, relied on the decision reported in Babubhai V. State
of Gujarat and Others [(2010) 12 SCC 254] contended that
more than one FIR is not permissible and if both the FIRs satisfy

the test of sameness, the second FIR is liable to be quashed. On
 2017KERIISS
(Cri. M,C. No, 5307 of 2017 3

the other hand, learned counsel for the 3% respondent contended
that though Annexure Al FIR was laid, the investigating agency
did not incorporate the relevant offences that were made out in
the FIS and did not conduct proper investigation. Hence, the 3°
respondent was justified in invoking the jurisdiction of the learned
Magistrate and the Magistrate was perfectly justified in invoking
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. To buttress the argument, the learned
counsel relied on the decision reported in Antony V. State of
Kerala [2001 (3) KLT 1 (SC)].

3. Annexure 5 final report itself shows that after the
registration of the second FIR, on finding that the allegations
related to the same incident, both were clubbed together and a
single investigation was conducted. It ended in Annexure 5 final
report. In Babubhai's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had
specifically held that there cannot be more than one FIR in
relation to the same cognizable offence. However, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that, in the case of a subsequent FIR, the
Court has to examine the facts and circumstances giving rise to
both the FIRs and the test of sameness is to be applied to find out

whether both the FIRs related to the same incident in respect of
 2017KERIISS
(Cri. M,C. No, 5307 of 2017 4
same occurrence or are in regard to the incidents which were two
‘or more parts of the same transaction

4. A perusal of Annexure 1 show that it related to
offences punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 34 IPC. The
allegations in the second FIS as well as in the private complaint
were on a different footing, though it related to the same incident.
To that extent, it cannot be said that there was sameness of FIRS
in both cases. In the above circumstance, the law laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Antony's case appear to be more
applicable to the facts of this case. Evidently, in the case at hand,

there was no fresh investi

ion pursuant to the second FIR. In

fact there was only single investigation after the registration of
both the crimes.

5. It was vehemently contended by the learned counsel
for the petitioners that the offence under the SC/ST (POA) Act was
not made out and that the predominant motive involved was the
property dispute. It was contended that the allegations raised
against the accused can only constitute, if at all, an offence under
Section 354 IPC and not under Section 3 of the SC/ST (POA) Act

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 3 respondent
 2017KERIISS
(Cri. M,C. No, 5307 of 2017 s
relied on the decision reported in Manju Devi V. Onkarjit Singh
Ahluwalia alias Omkarjeet Singh and Others (2017 Cri.LJ.
2879), wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had made the clear
distinction between an offence under Section 354 IPC and one
under Section 3 of SC/ST (POA) Act at paragraphs 14 & 15.
According to the Hon'ble Supreme Court when caste name is
used, that stands on a different footing from a mere offence under
Section 354 IPC. According to the Hon'ble Supreme Court it
involves an element of insulting the member of that community.
Of course, this is a matter to be established in the course of
evidence. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, 5
witnesses have been arrayed to establish the factual allegations.
Definitely the evidence of the witnesses has to stand the test of
cross examination. At this stage prima facie it cannot be said that
the ingredients of SC/ST (POA) Act is not made out and hence
liable to be quashed, at the initial stage itself.

6. Having considered these, | find no merit in the
contention set up by the petitioners and the Cri.M.C. is liable to
dismissed. However, the petitioners will be entitled to raise all

their objections before the court below and also urge the
 2017KERIISS
(Cri. M,C. No, 5307 of 2017 6

contentions raised here also. It is made clear that no finding is
arrived at regarding the allegations made by the petitioners
herein and whatever conclusions mentioned above are only for
the limited purpose of considering whether the provision under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. is liable to be invoked at this stage. Learned
counsel for the petitioners at this stage submitted that personal
‘exemption of the petitioners may be permitted. If appropriate
application is filed, the court below may consider the applications
in accordance with law

Crl.M.C. is dismissed as above.
