THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION oN
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 CrL.MC.No. 5469 OF 2020(C) a2. ao2umERI

ORDER
Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused Nos. 2 and 3 in Crime
No.717/2019 registered at the Binanipuram Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections 406,
420 and 468 r/w 34 of IPC. The de facto complainant,
at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed
as the 2™ respondent. Annexure-R2(a) affidavit has
been filed by 2" respondent. The allegation is that the
petitioners along with the 1* accused had transferred
the Hyundai Creta Car belonging to the de facto
complainant/2™ respondent by forging her signature.
The de facto complainant has now filed an affidavit
stating that the dispute has been resolved amicably
and she has no subsisting grievance against any of the
petitioners. The 1* accused is stated to be abroad and

therefore, has not been arrayed as party to this
 CrL.MC.No. 5469 OF 2020(C) 3. ao2umERI

Criminal M.C.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who,
on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no
criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavit filed by the 2™ respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
no public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote.
‘As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount
to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of
the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme
Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab
{(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of
Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is
 CrL.MC.No. 5469 OF 2020(C) whe ao2umERI

no impediment in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Cri.M.C is allowed. Annexure-I
FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.717/2019
registered at the Binanipuram Police Station, as

against the petitioners is quashed.
