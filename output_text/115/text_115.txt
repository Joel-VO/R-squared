BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.98 of 2024

Dated this the 22" day of January 2024

ORDER

Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C
to quash all proceedings against him.

2. Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.2314/2023 of
Palarivattom Police Station, registered for the offences under
Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 3°
respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, on 06.10.2023 the defacto
complainant went for an Ayurvedic treatment and the accused failed
to provide the treatment or return the money and thereby committed
the offences alleged.

4, Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the
petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,
considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be
served by continuing the proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303],

the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can

GRL.MC _NO.98 OF 2024

take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the

im
and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This
view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6
SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand
and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. | have perused Annexure A2 affidavit filed by the 3°
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon
verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the
defacto complainant stands by the contens thereof. | am satisfied
that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in
this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for
quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an
exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in Crime
No.2314/2023 of Palarivattom Police Station are quashed.

This Cr.M.C is allowed.
