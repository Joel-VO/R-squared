 Sotl2

16.Now let's examine whether the recovery of the gold ornaments in pursuance of
the information given by the accused is sufficient or not to tie the accused no.2
‘and 3 with the allegations or not .S.27 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that
‘8.27. How much of information received from accused may be proved:
Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of
information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a
police-officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession
‘or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved. As

per the Ext P2(a) statement accused no.2 while he was in the custody of police

stated that “ qviéanseoqmsmd offg asms anor aneMie ameawe sm20

onlay 990" . In pursuance of his statement the recovery of gold ornaments

were made by PW4 from Annamalai Gold Ornaments designers and makers
shop. In the Ext P2 (a) statement he is not stated anything about the place
‘where he sold the gold ornaments . As per his statement he merely said that he
will show the shop where he sold the gold ornaments .Is that sufficient to prove
the recovery? . In , State of Rajasthan v. Bhup Singh (1997) 10 SCC 675,the
‘Apex Court has observed the following as the conditions prescribed in Section
27 of the Evidence Act, 1872 for unwrapping the cover of the ban against the
admissibility of statement of the accused to the police (1) a fact should have
been discovered in consequence of the information received from the accused;
(2) he should have been accused of an offence; (3) he should have been in the

custody of a police officer when he supplied the information; (4) the fact so
 ot

discovered should have been deposed to by the witness. The Court observed
that if these conditions are satisfied, that part of the information given by the
accused which led to such recovery gets denuded of the wrapper of prohibition
and it becomes admissible in evidence, Apart from that the statement does not
contain any information about the place where he had sold out the gold ,not as
such stated.The statement should be such that the investigating officer would
bbe able to recover the gold even in the absence of the accused . Furthermore
the investigating officer i.e,PW4 has not deposed anything about the contents

of Ext P2 recovery mahasar.

17,In Anand Kumar v.State of Kerala 2024 KHC online 1517 it was observed
by the honourable apex court that ‘It is now well established that if the
investigating agency proposes to proceed with the recovery of material objects
‘on the basis of the confession made by the accused in police custody, the
presence of two independent witnesses shall be ensured from the very
inception when the accused starts making the disclosure. The statements so
made by the accused shall be recorded by the Investigating Officer in the
presence of those independent witnesses. Thereafter, the independent witnesses
should be present all along when the accused along with the Investigating
Officer proceeds to the place of concealment, and the accused retrieves the
material object, and it is handed over to the Investigating Officer. Furthermore,
the Investigating Officer and the independent witnesses have to depose before

the Court during trial about the whole course followed, right from the making
 100 12

of disclosures, till the retrieval and hand over of the material objects. It is trite
that the Investigating Officer has to depose before the Trial Court the facts
discovered in consequence of the information received from the accused ‘.In
the present case the recovery has not been effected in the presence of two
independent witness ,moreover PW3 himself though admitted his signature in
the Ext P2 mahasar has deposed that he doesn’t know the facts of the case as

well as the contents of Ext P2..

18,5.457 of Indian Penal Code 1860 provides Whoever commits lurking house-
trespass by night, or house-breaking by night in order to the committing of any
offence punishable with imprisonment, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall also be

liable to fine;

And, if the offence intended to be committed is theft, the term of the
imprisonment may be extended to fourteen years. S.380 of Indian Penal
Code states that Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel,
which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for
the custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be

liable to fine.

19.Though the gold ornaments were recovered ,since the recovery has not been

made in accordance with the mandate of .27 of the evidence Act ,based on
 tof 12

the dictum laid down by the hon'ble apex courts cited above, it can not be said
that the recovery, as far as the facts of this case is concemed, is proved by the
prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt . Apart from that there is no direct or
any circumstantial evidence to fasten accused nos. 2 and 3 with the allegations
levelled against them. For the said reason point no.1 and 2 are found against

the prosecution.

18,Boint No.3 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, Accused Nos. 2 and 3 are
found not guilty of offences punishable under sections 457 and 380 read with
section 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said
offences under section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Their bail
bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty. Case against accused No. 1 is

split up and refiled as CC. 65/2025.

The material objects were produced before this court as T No, 143/2013

will be destroyed after the appeal period is over according to law .
