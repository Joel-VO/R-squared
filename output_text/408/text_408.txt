Crl.M.C. No.4482 of 2014

Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018

Annexure-1 preliminary order passed by the Sub
Divisional Magistrate's Court, Devikulam under Section 111
Cr.P.C. is under challenge.

2. As per the report of the Sub Inspector of Police,
Nedumkandom, the petitioner was involved in Crime
No.545/2014 of Nedumkandom Police Station and the said
crime was registered for the offences under Sections 448
and 342 read with Sections 34 IPC and Section 118(d) of
the Kerala Police Act. The case is presently pending as
CC.521/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,
Nedumkandom.

3. Over and above the aforesaid case, the petitioner
 2018KERZU7
CALM.C.4482/2014

is not involved in any other criminal case. Annexure-1 order
is quite unnecessary and there was no reason for passing
such an order. The learned Sub Divisional Magistrate had
not applied his mind in the matter and the unnecessary
proceedings under Section 107 CrP.C. has been initiated.
Matters being so, Annexure-1 order and all further
proceedings in it are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-1
order and all further proceedings against the petitioner in it
are quashed.
