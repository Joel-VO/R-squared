‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 of 2018 3 2019KERID

ORDER

This pe

ition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (“the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash

the proceedings pending against the petitioners.

2. The petitioners herein are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime
No.677 of 2018 of the Edathala Police Station. In the said case,
they stand indicted for having committed offences punishable
under Sections 142, 143, 323, 324, 451, 341, 506 and 354 r/w.

Section 149 of the IPC.

3. According to the prosecution, on 29.09.2018 at about
6.30 a.m., the petitioners herein attacked the 2 respondent with

weapons.

4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, the party respondent and the learned Public
Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the

parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the
 cel

of 2018 ‘ 2019KERID

affidavit filed by the 2 respondent to buttress his submission. It
is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would

not affect public peace or tranquility.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions,
submitted that the statement of the 2” respondent has been
recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no

subsisting grievance.

6. have considered the submissions advanced.

7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC
303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC
466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes
between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the

criminal proceedings.

8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be

said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental
 cel

of 2018 s 2019KERID

depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case
will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing
of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about
peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting
with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the
prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered alll the relevant
circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be
well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section

482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Al
FIR in Crime No.677 of 2018 of the Edathala Police Station and all

proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
