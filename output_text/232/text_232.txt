ORDER
Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.233 of 2011 on the file of

the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam. Annexure Ais the
complaint. Gist of allegations against the petitioner is that he entered into
an agreement with the complainant for purchase of a land. Thereafter the
land was conveyed to the petitioner by virtue of a registered document. At
the time of finalisation of the deal an amount of %8,33,400/- was
outstanding as balance consideration. Leamed counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the vendoricomplainant had already agreed to sell this
property to one DrSaifu and there was some dispute between the
complainant and DrSaifu which was not known to the petitioner at the
time of purchase. Having came to know about that dispute, balance
amount was retained and that is mentioned in an agreement, which is
produced as Annexure E. Annexure F is the copy of the plaint filed by
DrSaifu against the complainant and his wife claiming compensation for
the breach of contract. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in

paragraph 2 of the petition, petitioner has specifically stated that the

amount of %8,33,400/- is retained by the petitioner as agreed to by the
 2014KERAT

Me Noa77a012 2
parties in Annexure E for meeting possible future expenses. It is also
submitted that immediately the civil suit is settled or disposed of, the
petitioner will pay the balance amount found to be due to the complainant
as stated in Annexure E. On going through the materials on record, | am
satisfied that the dispute predominantly is of a civil nature. The offence
of cheating alleged against the petitioner will not lie in a legal sense
because breach of an agreement cannot be termed as an offence falling
within the definition of cheating under Section 420. of the Indian Penal
Code, Therefore, the petition is to be allowed to meet the ends of justice.

In the result, petition is allowed. The complaint in C.C.No.233
of 2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV,
Kunnamkulam is hereby quashed.

Al pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed,

‘A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.
