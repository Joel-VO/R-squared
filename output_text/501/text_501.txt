ORDER

Dated this the 7th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.2/2020
registered at the Kasargod Police Station for offences
punishable under Sections 341 and 324 r/w 34 of IPC,
now pending as C.C.No.448/2020 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasargod. The
de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime
was registered, is arrayed as the 2™ respondent.
Annexure-E affidavit has been filed by 2™ respondent
stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the
incident and registration of the crime, has been
resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance
against the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
 2020KERAMIS

Ce1.MC.No.5679 OF 2020 (H!

who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners
have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavit filed by the 2 respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
no public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote.
‘As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount
to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of
the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme
Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab
{(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of
Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is

no impediment in granting the relief sought.
 2020KERAMIS

Ce1.MC.No.5679 OF 2020 (i

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in C.C.No.448/2020 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasargod is

quashed.
