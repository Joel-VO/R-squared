BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

CrLM.C. No. 26 of 2024

Dated this the 18% day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under
Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to quash

all proceedings against them.

2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C. No.234
of 2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court, Payyannur arising out of Crime No.456 of 2019 of
Pariyaram Police Station, Kannur, registered for the
offences under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 294(b) of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2% respondent is the defacto
complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, the accused had on
02-10-2019, scolded the defacto complainant using
abusive language and thereby committed the offences
alleged

4, Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned counsel for the respondents, apart from the
 2024KERII97
CRL.NC NO. 26 OF 2024
learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
that the matter has been settled and hence the
proceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed.
It was also submitted that, considering the nature of
offences alleged. no purpose would be served by continuing
the proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another
(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in
appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the
amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the
wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This
view was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v.
State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and
‘Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and
Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]

7. Lhave perused Annexure-A-2 affidavit filed by the
2° respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has
submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the
affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by
the contents thereof, I am satisfied that the matter has

been settled and no public interest is involved in this case.

There is no impediment for granting the prayer for
quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be
an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the
petitioners in C.C. No.234 of 2020 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Payyannur arising
out of Crime No.456 of 2019 of Pariyaram Police Station,
