ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

The petitioner claims to be the owner of a Tipper
Lorry bearing registration No.KL-40-D-2221. The said
vehicle was seized by the 3” respondent on
01.12.2020 on the allegation of having used the
vehicle for conversion of paddy land in violation of the
provisions of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land
and Wet Land Act, 2008. The grievance of the
petitioner is that respondents 2 to 4 failed to report
the seizure of the vehicle to the jurisdictional
Magistrate Court. The petitioner rely on Section
102(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to contend
that the respondents 2 to 4 are duty bound to report
the seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate Court,
failing which the petitioner will be denied an

opportunity to move for interim custody under Section
 Crl.Mc.Wo.8820 OF 2020(F) 23. aoumenn3s7

451 CrPC.

2. [heard the learned Public Prosecutor also. The
learned Public Prosecutor submits that the vehicle
was seized by the 3" respondent as directed by the 4"
respondent and handed over to the Police for custody.

I find merit in the contention that, having seized
the vehicle, the respondents 2 to 4 are bound to
report the seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate
Court. Accordingly, the Crl.M.C is disposed of with the
following directions;

(i) The competent among respondents 2

to 4 shall report seizure of the vehicle

bearing registration No.KL-40-D-2221

covered by Annexure-I to the jurisdictional

Magistrate Court within one week of

receipt of a copy of a copy of this judgment.

(i) On such report being submitted,
 Crl.Mc.Wo.8820 OF 2020(F) whee aoumenn3s7

the petitioner shall be at liberty to submit
application seeking interim custody of the
vehicle.

(iii) The application for interim custody, if
any filed, shall be considered by the
jurisdictional Magistrate and appropriate

orders passed without delay.
