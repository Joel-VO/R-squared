SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.66 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2017
ORDER

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 and 6 in C.C,No.612

of 2009 of Additional Chief ~—_Judicial_~— Magistrate,
Thiruvananthapuram for offences punishable under sections 143,
147, 149, 283, 294(b), 332, 353 of the Indian Penal Code,

2. Petitioners appeared before the court below through the
counsel in the above crime. Thereafter, they were either appearing
personally or were being represented by the counsel. The matter
stood posted to 16.02.2016, on which day, petitioners were absent.
Hence, court below issued non bailable warrant against the
petitioners. Bail bond was also cancelled.

3. Petitioners, contending that due to an inadvertent
communication gap with the counsel in informing about the case
remained absent and that, there was no willful latches on their side
have approached this Court seeking reliefs. It is submitted that
petitioners are ready to surrender before the magistrate and to seek
fresh bail. They apprehend that since the non bailable warrant is

pending, application for bail is not likely to be taken up on the same
 2017KERNGD

day of surrender itself.

4, Having considered the entire facts, I feel that since the
petitioners have been appearing promptly before the court earlier,
some leniency can be shown to the petitioners herein. This is
especially in the background that they offered to appear before the
court below and to participate in the future proceedings.

In the result, CrlLM.C is disposed of directing the
petitioners herein to appear before the jurisdictional court. within
ten days from today and to seek bail. In the event of any application
for bail being filed, court below shall take it up on the same day
itself and pass appropriate orders in the light of what is stated
above. Warrant issued by the court below will be kept in abeyance

till the appearance of the petitioners within the above stipulated

period.
