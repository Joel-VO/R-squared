THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5584 OF 2020 2020KERAS6I

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 7 in
Crime No.183/2019 registered at the
Kuruppanpadi Police Station, Ernakulam for
offences punishable under Sections 341, 323,
294(b), 143, 147, 149 of IPC, now pending as
C.C.No.132/2019 on the files of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-III,
Perumbavoor. The de facto complainants, at
whose instance the crime was registered, are
arrayed as the 2™ and 3 respondents.
Annexure-A3 and Annexure-A3(a) affidavits
have been filed by 2™ and 3" respondents
stating that the dispute, which was the
reason for the incident and registration of
the crime, have been resolved amicably and

they have no subsisting grievance against
 ‘caL.M.c.No.5584 OF 2020 2020KERAS6I

the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor
also, who, on instructions, submits that the
petitioners have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the injury
caused and having perused the affidavits
filed by the 2™ and 3* respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true
and voluntary, I am satisfied that the
dispute is settled and no public interest is
involved in this matter. Moreover, in view
of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is
remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State

of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh
 cmt.M.c.No. 5584 OF 2020 22UKERINS6E
5

v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10
SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting
the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.c is allowed.
The proceedings in C.C.No.132/2019 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-III, Perumbavoor is quashed.
