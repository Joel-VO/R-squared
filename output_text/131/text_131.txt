BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.119 of 2024

Dated this the 22" day of January 2024

ORDER

Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash all proceedings against him.

2. Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1493/2023 of Museum
Police Station alleging offences under Section 379 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860. The 3” respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, the accused stole the motor
cycle belonging to the defacto complainant bearing Reg.No. KL 01 AR
11450 and thereby committed the offences alleged.

4, Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the
petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,
considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be
served by continuing the proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 3031,

the Apex Court has held that

take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim

and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This
View was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6
SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand
and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. | have perused Annexure A2 affidavit filed by the 3°
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon
verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the
defacto complainant stands by the contens thereof. Though
the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is
involved in another crime of identical nature considering the nature
of settlement arrived at between the parties, | am of the view that no
purpose would be achieved by continuing the investigation into the
present crime. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for
quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an
exercise in futility,

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in Crime
No.1493/2023 of Museum Police Station are quashed.

The Cr.M.C. is allowed.
