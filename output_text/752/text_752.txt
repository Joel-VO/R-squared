ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure ("the Code" for brevity).

2. The 2 respondent is the de facto complainant in
C.C.No.1165 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First
Class-III, Kollam. The 1* petitioner is the husband and the
petitioners 2 and 3 are his parents. They are being proceeded
against for having committed offence punishable under Section

498A r/w. Section 34 of the IPC.

3. The instant proceeding is initiated with a prayer to
quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes.
‘The 2™ respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not
wish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the

petitioners.

4. The learned Public Prosecutor has obtained instructions.
He submits that the statement of the 2" respondent has been
recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the

proceedings as it involves no public interest.

5. I have considered the submissions advanced.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC
303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC
466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes
between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the
criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendr huvanshi
Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it
was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage
genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder
over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts
should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the
Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing,
but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also
require that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all

the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this

Court will be well jus

fied in invoking its extra ordinary powers

under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed.

against the petitioners now pending as C.C.No.1165 of 2017 on
the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Kollam are

quashed.
