Crl.M.(C).No.52 of 2017

Dated this the 10” day of January, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the accused who is indicted
in Crime No.96/2017 for offences punishable under
Sections 58 and 67 of the Abkari Act. He challenges the
order in Annexure-A2, which is an application for interim
custody of the vehicle owned by him and involved in the
case. The application was rejected. The reasons stated
by the court below is that, the report of the investigating
officer revealed that the confiscation proceedings were
going on at the instance of the Deputy Excise
Commissioner, Kollam. Consequently the court held that
it had no authority to release the vehicle and the petition
was consequently dismissed.

2. Challenging this, the learned counsel contended
that the order of the court below is not legally sustainable

in the light of the clear statutory provision holding that
 2017KERII2I7

(Cri.M.(C).No.52 of 2017,

the confiscation proceedings will not be a bar in ordering
the release of the vehicle. The learned counsel invited my
attention to the decision reported in [Abdul Nazer Vs
State of Kerala (2014 (3) KHC 3125)], wherein the
court considered this legal aspect and ultimately ordered
that the vehicle may be released subject to the execution
of the bond. However the learned counsel fairly invited
my attention to the clarification given by the Division
Bench of this court in unreported decision in W.A.No.1408
of 2016, wherein the Division Bench it confirmed that the
vehicle can be released on cash security and not on
execution of the bond. Necessarily, the value has to be
fixed by the court below on the basis of a report of the
competent authority as provided under the statute. The
learned counsel also fairly submitted that he can produce
an equivalent cash security as fixed by the court below.
In the light of above, the impugned order is set aside and
‘CMP.No.4127 of 2016 will stand allowed. The court below
shall assess the value of vehicle on the basis of materials

placed, as provided under the statute and release the
 2017KERII2I7

(Cri.M.(C).No.52 of 2017, 3

vehicle on such terms and conditions as it may fix as per
the statute as expeditiously as possible.

Crl.M.C is disposed of accordingly.
