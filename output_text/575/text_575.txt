THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON

11.01.2021,

‘THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 2020KERII767

ORDER

A consignment of 24 bottles of
‘Pankajakasthuri Breath Easy’ was entrusted
with a courier company, the accused for
exporting the same to America. But, the
customs authorities objected its export on the
ground that it is not a commercial goods, but
medicinal goods which requires certain other
legal formalities. Hence the same was returned
by the courier company along with the charge
received in that behalf. But the crime was
registered on the allegation that he sustained
heavy loss on account of its non-export. No
one can be permitted to plead ignorance
regarding the requirements to be complied with
while exporting medicinal goods. The failure on
the part of the complainant to comply with the
said requirement cannot be placed on the

shoulder of the accused. Further, no criminal
 3 2020KERII767

liability can be extended on the accused for
the wrong done by the defacto complainant. The
crime registered on the allegation of offence
under Section 420 IPC is really ill-conceived
and ill-motivated, without satisfying the
requirement which would constitute Section 415
IPC. Hence, the entire crime and the further
proceedings are quashed. Crl.M.C. is allowed

accordingly.
