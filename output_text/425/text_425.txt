Cri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016

Dated this the 3° day of August, 2016

ORDER

1.The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C.
No.180 of 2015 of the Additional Sessions Court,
(Fast Track) III, Manjeri. He is charged for having
committed offence punishable under Sections 341,
324 and 307 read with Section 34 of I.P.C.

2.As directed by this Court by Annexure-A2 order, the
petitioner had surrendered before the learned
Magistrate and he was granted bail subject to
conditions. Among other conditions , the petitioner
was also directed to produce his passport before the
court below.

3.The petitioner is running a grocery business in the

United Arab Emirates and in the said circumstances,
 201

il. M.C. No.4696 of 2016 2

he filed an application before the learned Sessions
Judge seeking release of the passport to travel
abroad for a period of six months. The said
application was allowed in part . The conditions

imposed are extracted below for easy reference.

2. The passport produced by the
petitioner in the above case is
released to him for a period of 6
months from today, on executing a
bond for the same with two solvent
sureties for an amount of
Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs
only) each.

3. The passport shall be released to the
petitioner on executing a bond as
aforementioned and getting a proper
acknowledge for the same.

4. It is directed that, the accused
No.1/petitioner shall not leave the
territory of India by using the existing
passport or with the renewed
passport, without the consent of this
Court.

5. The petitioner is directed to produce
the renewed passport before this
Court within 10 days from the date of
receipt of the same from the
competent authorities.

 201

il. M.C. No.4696 of 2016 +

4.Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the
petitioner and learned Public Prosecutor.

5.The petitioner, it appears, is aggrieved by some of
the passing references made by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge in the impugned order. It
is observed by the court below that the petitioner
cannot be permitted to go abroad as he did seek to
modify the conditions imposed by the Magistrate. It
is also submitted that the directions that the
petitioner should execute a bond for two solvent
sureties for an amount of Rs.2 lakhs surety is
onerous. The learned counsel prays that the
petitioner be permitted to travel abroad for a period
of six months at least in order to enable him to take
care of his business abroad. Much reliance is placed
by the learned Counsel on the order of this Court in
S.K.Asok Kumar V State of Kerala 2009 (2) KLT

712 to advance his contentions.

 201

il. M.C. No.4696 of 2016 oa

6.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand,
submitted that the petitioner is involved in a grave
offence and it was after considering the various
inputs that the learned Additional Sessions Judge
had imposed the aforesaid conditions. It is
submitted that the petitioner can always approach
the learned Sessions Judge and seek permission to
travel abroad and nothing in the Annexure AS order
prevents him from doing the same.

7.1 have considered the rival submissions. The
likelihood of the case coming up for trial in the near
future is very remote. The period sought for by the
petitioner to travel abroad is for 6 months. The
mere fact that the petitioner had not challenged the
order passed by the learned Magistrate is not
sufficient reason to deny him permission to travel
abroad. However, the bond amount imposed by the

Court below cannot be said to be onerous.

 201

il. M.C. No.4696 of 2016 ss

8.Having regard to the facts and circumstances, I
direct the learned Sessions Judge to grant
permission to the petitioner to travel abroad for a
period of six months. The petitioner shall execute
the necessary bond before the Court below for the
amount ordered and the court may also impose
necessary conditions to ensure his presence before
the court at the stage of trial.

Petition is allowed as above.
