Cri.M.C, No.4312 of 2016

Dated this the 3" day of August, 2016

1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 to 6 in
Crime No.234 of 2016 of the Melattur Police Station, They
are proceeded against for having committed offences
punishable under Sections 143, 147, 323, 506 and 149
IPC and Section 3(1)(v) of the SC/ST (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, 1989. The 2™ respondent is the victim.

2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the
Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.
State_of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of
other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v.
State of Punjab and another (2014) 6 SCC 466) and
 2016KERI1879

CriLM.C. No.4312 of 2016 2

Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand

[2014 (9) SCC 653] with a prayer to quash the above
proceeding.

3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above
judgments have delineated the circumstances and the
cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be
invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the
purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed
that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings .

4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of
court settlement and there is no acrimony between them
at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved
and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 2”
respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts

that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings.

CriLM.C. No.4312 of 2016 3

5.The crux of the prosecution allegation is that on
26.05.2016 at about 8.30 p.m., the petitioners along with
other accused formed themselves into an unlawful
assembly and voluntarily caused hurt to the 2”
respondent.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that no other cases of heinous nature are reported
against the petitioners.

7.1 have bestowed my anxious consideration to the
submissions made across the bar and I have also gone
through the materials on record.

8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted
that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in
quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between the
parties have been resolved and the parties are living in
peace and harmony .

9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in
 2016KERI1879

CriLM.C. No.4312 of 2016 4

nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is
also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of
compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as
the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to
continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility
of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in
putting the de facto complainant and the accused to
unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur
well for the interest of the community and will enable the
parties to live in peace and harmony.

10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in
quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case
falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex
Court in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases
referred to above.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further

proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused

Nos. 1 to 6 in Crime No.234 of 2016 of the Melattur Police

Station, are quashed.
