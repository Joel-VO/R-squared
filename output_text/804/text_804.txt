ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2020

Petitioner is the registered owner of the lorry
bearing Regn.No.TN-57/Xx-9999, which was allegedly
‘involved in crime No.1255/2019 of mannancherry
Police Station for having allegedly committed
offences punishable under section 279 of the IPC
and under section 139 of the Indian Electricity
Act. The vehicle is presently exposed to sun and
rain. The petitioner had therefore approached
court below with Crl.MP No.7128/2019 seeking
release of the vehicle. The application was
dismissed vide Annexure-Al order dated 24.12.2019
for the reason that the accused has not been
arrested so far, and that if the vehicle is
released, there is remote chance for the accused to
surrender before the court or to apprehend him.
That apart, it was also observed that the vehicle
could not be traced out and seized in case of any

violation of condition imposed by the court and
 2n20KERDSS

therefore ordered not to release the vehicle. The
explanation given by the learned 1rIrd Addl.
sessions Judge, sitting as a vacation Judge, does
not appear to be very reasonable because no purpose
would be served by letting the vehicle to be
damaged exposing it to sun and rain. It is
submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner/accused that the accused had obtained
anticipatory bail and he has not yet been arrested.
The concern of the court is only to realise the
damage, if any, sustained due to the use of the
vehicle belonging to the petitioner. According to
the learned Senior public Prosecutor, the
Department has sustained a damage worth
Rs.60,000/-.

In view of the above, the petition to get the
vehicle released is allowed on condition that the
petitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.60,000/-
(Rupees sixty thousand only) with two solvent
sureties each for the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial court and also on deposit

of Rs.60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) in cash
 before the trial court.

The Criminal M.c. is allowed.
