Cri. M. C, Nos. 4595 & 4596 of 2016
Dated this the 3” day of August, 2016
ORDER

These Crl.M.C.s arise from C.C.No.105/2016 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam in Crime
No.267/2016 of Koothattukulam Police Station for offences
punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324,
326, 354, 506(ii), 427, 294(b) read with Section 149 of IPC.
C.C.No.164/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Koothattukulam arises. from Crime _—_No.278/2016 for
Koothattukulam Police Station for offences punishable under
Sections 341, 323, 324 read with Section 34 of IPC.

2. In C.C.No.105/2016, the allegation is that, the
petitioners herein had attacked the defacto complainant and
others and caused bodily injuries. One person sustained
dislocation of his shoulder bone. On the basis of the complaint
lodged, crime was registered. After investigation, final report was
laid.

3. In C.C.No.164/2016, the allegation of the prosecution is
that, the petitioners herein who are the defacto complainant in

C.C.No.105/2016 had attacked the respondents herein who are
 2010KERII88

Cri. M, C. Nos. 4595 & 4596 of 2016

the accused in C.C.No.105/2016 and caused bodily injuries. On
the basis of a complaint lodged, crime was registered and after
investigation final report was filed.

4, Pending the proceedings, both parties have
approached this Court stating that the respective cases have
been resolved between the accused and the defacto complainant
in each case. In Cri.M.C. 4595/2016 affidavits have been filed by
the defacto complainant and the injured as Annexures A3, A4 and
AS. In Crl.M.C. No.4596/2016 affidavits have been filed by the
defacto complainant and the 2° respondent injured as Annexures
A3 and A4.

5. The leamed Pu

Prosecutor on _ instructions
submitted that the petitioners herein are not involved in any other
crime. It appears that, regarding the running of quarry, there was
certain disputes between the management and locals, which
seems to have led to this case and counter case. Since both sides
have resolved to settle the issue and to give a quietus to the
entire litigation, | feel that, it is liable to be permitted. Even
though, in Crime No.267/2016 there is an offence alleged is one

including Section 326, having regard to the fact that the injury is
 2010KERII88

Cri. M, C. Nos. 4595 & 4596 of 2016

only a dislocation of the shoulder bone and not on a very vital
part of the body, | am inclined to grant permission to settle the
dispute.

In the result, Cri.M.C.s are allowed and all further
proceedings C.C.Nos.105/2016 & 164/2016 of Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam stand quashed.
