‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 257 of 2017

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the 5° accused in Crime
No.1206/2014 of Hosdurg Police Station for offences punishable
under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 427, 436, 448 read with 149
of IPC. After investigation final report was laid and the matter is
now pending as C.P.No.94/2016 of Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court - 1, Hosdurg.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the
petitioner was abroad and hence he could not participate in the
proceedings. Now having came to know about the proceedings,
he offers to surrender before the court below and to submit
himself to the jurisdiction. His only apprehension is that, he may
be detained and his bail application is not likely to be taken up on
the same day.

3. Having considered the above prayer and hearing both
sides, | am satisfied that the grievance of the petitioner herein is
sustainable. Hence, the Cri.M.C. is disposed of with a direction
that, in the event of the petitioner herein surrendering before the

court below within 2 weeks from today and filing an application
 2017KERII702
Crl.M, C. No, 257 of 2017

for bail, the court below shall take up the bail application on the
same day and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.
The warrant, if any, issued by the court below, will be kept in
abeyance till the actual date of his appearance within the above

stipulated time.
