Cri. M.C No. 6266 of 2013

Dated this the 01" day of January, 2014.
ORDER

Petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 and 3 in O.R. No.

9/98 of Nelliampathy Forest Range. The offences alleged are

punishable under Sections 27(1)(e)(iii) and of Kerala

Forest Act. The Crl.M.C is filed seeking to quash charge sheet
and all further proceedings in C.C No. 852/2005 now pending
as LPR No. 1/2010 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Alathur,

2. There are 8 accused in the crime. All accused
except accused Nos. 1, 3 & 8 faced trial and they were
acquitted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur.
Annexure-B is the copy of the judgment dated 08/12/2005 in
C.C No. 695/01

3. The accused No. 5 confessed in P3 statement that
four persons along with him had committed the offence of
tress-pass and felling of trees along with accused Nos. 2 and 3.
After referring to Annexure-P2 mahazar and P3 confession
statement, the learned Magistrate found that the
discrepancies in the extract of confession contained in P3 and

P4 confession given by AS are not explained by PW2. It was
 2O1AKERIS
(Cx. MC No. 6206 0f 2013 :

also observed that there are no independent attestors to the
statement purportedly recorded by PW2. The learned
Magistrate concluded that P3 statement cannot be relied
upon without corroboration from other sources and that the
discrepancies discussed above appearing in P3 and P4 remains
unexplained. In the circumstances, the court found that
complainant has not succeeded in proving the offences against
the accused. The learned Magistrate found that accused
Nos.A2, A4 to A7 are not guilty of having committed the
offence.

4. The case against the remaining accused was split
up and refiled as C.C No, 852/05 and is now pending as LPR
No. 01/2010. It is submitted that in the light of the acquittal
of the co-accused there is no scope for proceeding against the
remaining accused since the prosecution has mainly relied
upon the confession statement of the fifth accused and that
the court below has disbelieved the confession made by the
fifth accused. Since the other accused were acquitted, for the
very same set of reasons, this Court is of the view that no
purpose would be served by continuing the prosecution

against the petitioner.
