P.UBAID, J.

CrL.M.C. No.8325 of 2017

Dated this the 7 day of December 2017
ORDER

The petitioner claims to be the registered owner of the
motorcycle No.KL-02-AR-9235. On 17.9.2017 at about 7.30
p.m., a small quantity of 20 gms of ganja was seized from the
possession of the petitioner by the Excise Inspector of the
Karunagappally Excise Range. The petitioner's motorcycle was
also seized by the Excise Inspector at that time. Later, the
motorcycle was released to the petitioner under Section 451
CrP.C. by the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate,
Karunagappally on certain conditions as per the order in
CMP.3270/2017 dated 5.10.2017. The petitioner is aggrieved
by the condition directing deposit of a cash security of
%31,500/-, and the said condition is sought to be set aside.

2. On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the
materials, I find nothing to show that the vehicle was in fact
used for the transportation of ganja. Just because it is the
vehicle on which the accused travelled, it cannot be confiscated

under the law. The small quantity of ganja was seized from the
 20171KERIIS7I
(CrLM.C, No.8325 of 2017

possession of the accused. It was not concealed any where on
the vehicle, and the vehicle was not in any manner used for the
transportation of ganja. Any way, proceedings are now going
on, rightly or wrongly.

3. _ In the above circumstances, where the very seizure of
the vehicle was quite unnecessary, I feel it appropriate to set
aside the condition directing cash security for the interim
custody of the vehicle under Section 451 Cr.P.C. The other
conditions imposed by the court below will suffice to cause
production of the vehicle, as and when required.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The impugned

condition directing cash security of %31,500/- will stand set

aside.
