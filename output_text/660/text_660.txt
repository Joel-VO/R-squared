CrILM.C. No.8168 of 2017

Dated this the 7" day of December, 2017
ORDER

Petitioners are accused in Crime No.357 of 2014 of
Bedakam Police Station, which is now pending as C.C.No.3705
of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l,
Kasaragod, for the offences punishable under Sections 323,
324 and 506 (ii) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably settled
between the parties.

3. On going through the facts and circumstances of the
case, it seems that the matter can be permitted to be settled.
No criminal antecedents have been reported against the
petitioners. The second respondent has filed separate affidavits
as Annexure A3, affirming that the matter has been amicably
settled between him and the petitioners and he has no

complaint against the petitioners. Considering the fact that

CrL.M.C. No.8168 of 2017

the matter has already been settled amicably between the
parties, this court is satisfied that no purpose would be served
in proceeding with the trial of the case. Matters being so, all
further proceedings in C.C.No.3705 of 2014 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, in Crime No.357 of
2014 of the Bedakam Police Station, are liable to be quashed.
In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings in C.C.No.3705 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod, in Crime No.357 of 2014 of

the Bedakam Police Station, are hereby quashed.
