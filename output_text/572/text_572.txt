Cri. M.C No.6916 of 2014

Dated this the 8" day of January, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the original accused No.4 in Crime
No.570/2009 of the Nadakkavu Police Station of Kozhikode District,
registered under Sections 143, 147, 148, 448, 323 and 324 r/w 149 IPC
on the complaint of one Thaslim Arif, that the petitioners and his co
accused assaulted him and his friend Musthafa, and inflicted injuries on
their body with weapons. The above of crime was registered as a
counter case to another crime involving a sessions offence. Being a
counter case to the other crime involving a sessions offence committal to
the court of Session was required. The original accused Nos. 1 and 2
faced trial before the learned Principal Assistant Sessions Judge,
Kozhikode in S.C No.47/13, and obtained a judgment of acquittal under
Section 232 Cr.P.C, when none of the material witnesses examined by the
prosecution supported the prosecution. The case against the accused
Nos. 3 and 4 was split up and refiled. Now the case against the petitioner
herein is pending in the register of long pending cases as L.P No.2/2014.
‘The petitioner now seeks orders quashing the prosecution as against him
on the ground that in the above circumstances of acquittal of the others

in the absence of any incriminating circumstance, continuance of the
 21SKERZYS

CCl, M.C No.6916 of 2014 2
prosecution as against him will not serve any purpose. The Annexure AS
Judgment in S.C No.47/2013 shows that the prosecution examined 7
witnesses in that case including the de facto complainant Thaslim Arif,
and marked Exts. P1 to P6. Of course, the prosecution could not procure

the presence of the other injured

ess cited as CW2. It was reported
to the trial that he is not available for examination, and that his
whereabouts are not known. The de facto complainant (first informant)
Thaslim Arif examined as PW2 did not in any manner support the
prosecution. The occurrence witnesses examined by the prosecution also
did not support the prosecution during trial. The judgment shows that
they all tured hostile during trail, in view of a settlement arrived at out
of court by the parties.

2. This court directed the Station House Officer to report
whether CW2 cited by the prosecution is now available at the locality for
‘examination. On instruction, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that
he is still not available, and that his whereabouts are not known, The
substratum of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the acquittal of
the others under Section 232 Cr.P.C. No doubt, the prosecution cannot in
any manner improve the case as against the others, and the material
witnesses also will not in any manner help the prosecution, if the case
against the others goes to trial. Practically, continuance of prosecution
against the others will be a sheer waste of time. That the petitioner

absconded, or that the case now stands transferred to the register of long
 21SKERZYS
Cri. M.CNo.6916 of 2014 3

pending cases cannot be a ground to deny relief, when the court is well
satisfied that continuance of the trial process against him will not serve
any purpose.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the

petitioner herein in crime No.570/2009 of the Nadakavu Police Station,
which is now pending before the court of Session, Kozhikode in L.P

No.2/2014 will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

JUDGE
