ORDERxx

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (‘the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the

proceedings pending against the petitioner.

2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.466 of
2018 of the Pallithottam Police Station, Kollam, registered under

Sections 341 and 323 of the IPC.

3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, the party respondents and also the learned Public
Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the
parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the
affidavits filed by the party respondents to buttress his submission.

It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would

not affect public peace or tranquility.

4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded
and she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting

grievance.

5. I have considered the submissions advanced.

6. _ In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ((2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],
the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High
Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between
the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal

proceedings.

7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said
to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental
depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will
have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of
proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and
secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the
prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects
of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant
circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be
well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482

of the Code to quash the proceedings.

CAMCNo.8370/18 4

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A2
Final Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the
petitioner in C.C No. 439/2018 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate
of First Class-III, Kollam are quashed.
