Cri, M. C. No. 2874 of 2016

Dated this the 1* day of June, 2016
ORDER
The matter was argued at length by both sides.

2. Having regard to the nature of allegations, | feel that,

this is not a matter to be quashed in exercise of powers under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. In the above circumstances, both sides

submitted that, direction may be given to the court below to

expedite the proceedings to avoid agony of both sides. 3.

Having regard to this, | am inclined to direct the court below to

take up the Sessions Case No.638/2015 and to dispose it of, at

the earliest, having regard to the pendency of the cases and also

other matters which require priority.

Crl.M.C. stands closed with the above observation.
