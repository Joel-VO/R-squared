Cri. M. C. No. 4898 of 2016

Dated this the 3” day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein challenges the order of the court below
in CMP No.2404/2016 in MC (DV) No.167/2011. The petitioner
herein had filed the MC seeking reliefs in the year 2011.
Thereafter, it appears that, there was a direction for a time bound
disposal of that case. The court was proceeding with the case to
be disposed of on or before 14.06.2016, as per the order in MC
No.793/2015 dated 09.02.2015 of the Hon'ble High Court. At that
time, the petitioner herein filed the amendment application.
Hence, the learned Magistrate addressed the High Court to seek
extension of time. Even the court below has noted that, several
petitions were filed by the petitioner one after another and hence
court could not dispose of the case within the time stipulated.
The court below holding that the application was highly belated,
allowed the application subject to payment of cost of €1,000/- to
be paid within 3 days. This is under challenge in this petition.

2. Heard the petitioner in person at length and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

3. The impugned order speaks by itself. Even though the
 2016KERI1889
Cri. M, C. No, 4898 of 2016

case was initiated by the party in person in the year 2011, it could
not be brought to the logical conclusion, due to various reasons.
Even the court below has taken note of the fact that the petitions
were being filed one after another, considerably delaying the
entire procedure. The petitioner herein cannot now lament of

delay after being a party for such delay. On enquiry from the

party-in-person itself, it is revealed that, at least six proceedings
are pending arising out of matrimonial discord in various courts
including two before this Court.

4, The only ground on which the impugned order is
challenged is that, she is without any means, she has no
employment and that she has no other source of income. Prima
facie, the fact that she herself has been contesting the
proceedings in various courts and she herself claims to be a B.Sc
B.Ed graduate, belies her contention.

5. _ Having regard to the entire facts and in the interest of
justice, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to delete the
Portion imposing cost only to ensure that the matter is not further
delayed under the guise of pendency of this Crl.M.C.

6. Hence, Cri.M.C. is disposed of confirming the impugned
 2016KERI889
(Cri. M.C. No, 4898 of 2016 3

order however, by directing that the cost as ordered by the court
though legally correct, need not be insisted upon. It is made clear

that, the petitioner herein shall carry out the amendment in the
presence of the Junior Superintendent of that Court within 5 days

from today. If this order is not complied with, within 5 days from
today, the benefit of amendment will not be available to the
petitioner herein. Issue copy forthwith to the petitioner. She shall

produce it before the court below within the above 5 days.
