Crl.M.C.No. 2606 of 2015

Dated this the 28th day of April, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner has filed this Criminal Miscellaneous Case
seeking to quash order dated 31.03.2015 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram in C.M.P. No, 717/2015 in
Crime No. 86/2015 of Kondotty Police Station. Goods carriage
bearing registration No.KL-10-T-9988 owned by the petitioner is
taken into custody by the police during December 2014,
alleging contravention of the provisions of the Kerala Protection
of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2002
and the Rules made thereunder.

2. A ccrime has been registered against the driver of the
vehicle. The petitioner applied before the Magistrate Court
seeking interim custody of the vehicle by filing an application
under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which

resulted in Annexure A1 order passed by the court below. The
 Cri.M.C.No, 2606 of 2015 201SIKERIITASS

petitioner is aggrieved by condition No. 3 of Annexure Al order
by which he has been directed to produce bank guarantee for
Rs. 53,000/- in order to release the vehicle in question. Going
by the averments in the Cri. M.C., the vehicle in question was
valued at Rs. 75,000/- by the Assistant Motor Vehicles
Inspector. The conditions imposed by the court below in
Annexure A1 order reads as follows:-
1) Petitioner shall execute a bond of Rs. 75,000/-
with two solvent sureties each for the like sum.
2) Petitioner shall deposit Rs. 22,000/- in the court.
3) Petitioner shall produce security of bank
guarantee for Rs. 53,000/-
4) Petitioner shall produce photograph and CD of
the vehicle.

 Cri.M.C.No, 2606 of 2015 201SIKERIITASS

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.

4. A reading of Annexure Al order passed by the court
below would show that after considering the rival contentions,
the court below has ordered interim custody of the vehicle in
question to the petitioner after imposing certain conditions. The
conditions imposed by the court below cannot be turned either
arbitrary or otherwise, warranting interference of this Court
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also
taking note of condition No. 1 imposed by the court below in
Annexure A1 order, I deem it appropriate to modify the
condition Nos. 2 and 3 in Annexure A1 order as follows:-

i) The petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs. 30,000/-
(Rupees Thirty Thousand Only) in the court.

ii)The petitioner shall furnish adequate security for the
balance sum of Rs. 45,000/- (Rupees Forty Five
Thousand Only), to the satisfaction of the court

below.
 Cri.M.C.No, 2606 of 2015 201SIKERIITASS

On satisfying the above conditions as well as condition
Nos. 1 and 4 to 7 in Annexure A1 order, the petitioner shall be
entitled for interim custody of the vehicle.

The Cri.M.C. is disposed of as above.

ANIL K.NARENDRAN,
JUDGE
