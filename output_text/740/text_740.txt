‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 Cel.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 20191KERIIDAS

ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (‘the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the

proceedings pending against the petitioner.

2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C, No.1111 of
2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vaikom.
In the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having committed
offence punishable under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) and 506(i) of

the IPC. The 3” respondent is the wife of the petitioner herein.

3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.
It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have
been amicably resolved. Attention of this Court is invited to the
affidavit filed by the 3° respondent to buttress his submission. It is
urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not

affect public peace or tranquility.

4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted

that the statement of the 3 respondent has been recorded and she
 Cel.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 20191KERIIDAS
3

has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.

I have considered the submissions advanced.

6. _ In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],
the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High
Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between
the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal

proceedings.

7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to
be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental
depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will
have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of
proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and
secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the
prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects
of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant

circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be

well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482

of the Code to quash the proceedings.
 Cel.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 20191KERIIDAS

4

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A FIR
and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now
pending as C.C. No. 1111 of 2018 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of
First Class, Vaikom are quashed.
