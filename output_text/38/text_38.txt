Cri. M.C No. 26 of 2015

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the two accused in C.C
No.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - 1,
Kasaragod. Crime in this case was registered under Sections 341,
323, 324, 506(i) r/w 34 IPC on the complaint of one Vanish, S/o
Kunhanna Moolya. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the
prosecution on the ground that they and the de facto complainant
have come to terms amicably out of court. The de facto
complainant Vanish is the first respondent in this proceeding. He
has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with
the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that the
parties have really come to terms. In such a situation, continuance
of the prosecution will not serve any purpose, other than wasting
the precious time of the court, because nobody will support the
prosecution, if the case goes to trial.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against

the petitioners in C.C. No.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court- I, Kasaragod will stand quashed under Section
 201SKERAU

rl. M.C No. 26 of 2015 2

482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released
from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them

will stand discharged.

JUDGE
