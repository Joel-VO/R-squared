BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.319 of 2024

Dated this the 12 day of January, 2024

ORDER

By order dated 23.02.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.3910 of 2022 in
CrIA.No.17 of 2022, the learned Sessions Judge permitted the petitioner
to apply for a passport with a short validity of one year. Petitioner
submits that unless the passport has a validity of five years, the
residence permit already granted to her, will not be extended by the
German Government.

2. I have heard Sri.Babu S.Nair, the learned counsel for the
petitioner, Smt-Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as well as
Sri.Manu S., the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India.

3. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the prosecution
had no objection in the petitioner being issued with a passport. Since
there is no objection from the prosecution and the criminal case is at the
appellate stage, petitioner's presence before the court during the
pendency of the appeal is not necessary. Further, the court has already
directed the issuance of the passport to the petitioner. In such
circumstances, granting validity for the passport for a period of five years
would not cause any prejudice to the prosecution.

Therefore, in modification of Annexure E order, petitioner is

permitted to apply for a passport with a validity of five years. If in case

such application is filed, the 3% respondent shall reissue the passport to
the petitioner with a validity of five years, provided she is otherwise
eligible, Petitioner shall however file an affidavit providing the details of

her residential address in Germany to the 3” respondent.

‘The Cri.M.C.is disposed of as above.
