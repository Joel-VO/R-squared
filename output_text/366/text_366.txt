 e1.MC.4o,3615 OF 2013 2 2021/KER/I229

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

‘The petitioner is the accused in C.P No.23/2013 on the file of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. The above
case is chargesheeted against the petitioner alleging offences
punishable under Sections 23 and 26 of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (for short ‘the JJ Act’).

2, The prosecution case is that on 17.10.2011 at about
5.40 pm, charge witness No.1, the Sub Inspector of Police,
Ambalamedu Police Station while on patrolling duty found charge
witness No.2 Saravanan, aged 16 years near Eathikkara, Kappela.
When the child was questioned, he deposed that from June
onwards, the petitioner kept minor Saravanan for the purpose of
hazardous employment at his shop No.II/235 of Thiruvaniyoor
Grama Panchayath and assaulted him. So the accused is alleged
to have committed offences punishable under Sections 23 and 26
of the JJ Act.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Public Prosecutor.
 cel.Me.No.3615 OF 2013 3 202UKERII229

4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if
the entire allegations are accepted, the offence under Sections
23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and
circumstances of the case. The counsel submitted that
Annexure 3 is the transfer certificate of the child issued by the
Head Master, U.M UP School, Meenakshi Nagar, Madurai East,
Madurai in which the date of birth of the petitioner is
mentioned as 26.5.1993. The counsel submitted that the
alleged incident in this case is happened on 17.10.2011.
According to the counsel, as on that date the 2° respondent is
aged more than 18 years and therefore the offence is not prima
facie made out. The counsel also submitted that even if the
averments in the final report is accepted, the offences under
Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and
circumstances of the case. According to the counsel, even the
job allegedly given to the child is not hazardous in nature.

5. The Public Prosecutor submitted that the offence
under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is attracted in this case
and it is a matter of evidence and this Court may not interfere
with the final report under Section 482 CRC

6. When this Crl.M.C came up for consideration, this

Court admitted the case and a stay order was also passed. This
 Cel.me.No.3615 OF 2013 4 202UKERII2I9

Criminal Miscellaneous Case is pending before this Court from
2013 onwards.

7. The main allegation in Annexure 2 final report is
extracted hereunder:

8. Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is extracted

hereunder:

"23. Punishment for cruelty to juvenile or child.—
Whoever, having the actual charge of, or control over, a juvenile
or the child, assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the
Juvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned,
‘exposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile
or the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
six months, or fine, or with both.

26. Exploitation of juvenile or child employee —Whoever
ostensibly procures a juvenile or the child for the purpose of any
hazardous employment keeps him in bondage and withholds his
earnings or uses such earning for his own purposes shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
 cel.Me.No.3615 OF 2013 s 202UKERII229

three years and shall also be liable to fine.”

9. After going through the averments in the final report,
according to me, it is very difficult to accept the prosecution
case that the petitioner committed the offences under Sections
23 and 26 of the JJ Act. The petitioner has got a case based on
Anneuxre 3 transfer certificate that as on the date of the
alleged incident, the 2" respondent is aged more than 18 years.
Moreover, to attract the offence under Section 23 of the JJ Act,
the prosecution has to establish that the accused is having the
actual charge of, or control over, a juvenile or the child and he
assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or
causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or
neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child
unnecessary mental or physical suffering. There is no evidence
to prima facie show that the petitioner assaults, abandons,
exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile. Similarly to attract
Section 26 of the Act the accused should ostensibly procures a
juvenile or the child for the purpose of any hazardous
employment keeps him in bondage and withholds his earnings
or uses such earning for his own purposes. There is no
evidence even to show that the employment was hazardous in

nature. Therefore, even if the entire allegations in the final
 cel.Me.No.3615 OF 2013 2021/KER/I229

report are accepted, according to me, the offences under
Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted.

10. Moreover, as per Annexure 3 transfer certificate, the
age of the 2"' respondent will be more than 18 years as on the
date of the alleged incident. Considering the entire facts and
circumstances of the case, according to me, the continuation of
the proceedings against the petitoiner is an abuse of process of
aw.

Therefore, this Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
in C.P No.23/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Kolencherry are quashed.
