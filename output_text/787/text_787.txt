 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018

Petitioners are the accused in CC No.1988/2017
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg,
which has arisen from Crime No.409/2017 of Ambalathara
Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections
341 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably
settled between the petitioners and the de facto
complainant, who is the 2° respondent herein. The 3”
respondent is the other injured.

3. Respondents 2 and 3 have filed Annexures-All
and Alll affidavits respectively, affirming that the matter has
been amicably settled between them and the petitioners and
presently, they have no complaints against the petitioners.

When the matter is settled between the parties, no purpose
 (Cx.M.C.8975/2017

would be served in proceeding with the matter further.
Matters being so, all further proceedings against the
petitioners in CC No.1988/2017 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, which has arisen from Crime
No.409/2017 of Ambalathara Police Station, can be
quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings against the petitioners in CC No.1988/2017 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, which
has arisen from Crime No.409/2017 of Ambalathara Police
Station, are quashed.
