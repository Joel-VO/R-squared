BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J

Cr.M.C.No.70 of 2024

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.1044/2020 of the
Emakulam Central Police Station, now pending as.

C.C.No.1205/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court-Il, Ernakulam, for the offences punishable
under Section 323, 324 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.

2. According to the prosecution, on 01.07.2020 the first petitioner
threw a cement block on the leg of the son of the de facto
complainant, while the 2" petitioner kicked him and thereby
committed the offences alleged.

3. Sri.D.G.

pin, the learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted

that the complaint has been filed with mala fides and solely to

wreak vengeance due to a dispute pending between the

parties. It was further submitted that 0.S.No.206/2018 filed by

the the 2" petitioner against the de facto complainant is
 224KERIGO

pending and that the present complaint has been initiated only

to compel the petitioners to settle the said civil dispute. It was
further submitted that the entire prosecution allegations are
false and that, none of the offences are even made out.

|. SriM.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor, submitted that the
nature of the allegations in the final report reveals that the
same is a matter for trial.
On a perusal of the final report as well as the statement
produced along with it, this Court notices that there are factual
allegations, which require appreciation of facts. The remedy

under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be involved in such an

instance.
Apart from the above, the petitioner has remedies available

under the Cr.

-, to seek discharge from the offences alleged.
Recourse to the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. ought to
be availed of only in exceptional circumstances where the
materials collected by the investigating officer, even if admitted,
would not make out an offence as alleged or when there are

proved mala fides.
 224KERIGO

‘

7. As observed above, a perusal of the allegations in the final
report and the records will reveal that such a remedy under
Section 482 of CrP.C. is not available to the petitioners.
Therefore, I find no merit in the CrLM.C. and the same is
dismissed.

8, However, the dismissal of this Crl.M.C. shall not stand in the
way of the petitioners taking recourse to other remedies

available under law.
