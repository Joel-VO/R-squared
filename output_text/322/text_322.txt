Crl.M.C.No.2547 of 2015

Dated this the 24" day of April 2015

ORDER

This is an application filed by the petitioner, who is the
accused in C.P.No.38/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court, Adoor for issuing a direction to the leamed Magistrate,
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter
called the Code).

2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the sole
accused in O.R. No.169 of 2013 of Excise Range Adoor and she
was charge sheeted alleging offence under Section 55(i) of the
Abkari Act, on the allegation that on 10.8.2013 the second
respondent alleged to have found her selling foreign liquor and on

seeing the excise party she ran away from the place. ‘The police
 201SKERN7R2

(CALM.C.2547/2015 2

party have not arrested her. It appears that final report has been
filed and now it is pending as C.P.No,38/2015 before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court, Adoor. The petitioner apprehends
that if she surrenders before the court below, she is likely to be
remanded and the application for bail will not be considered. So
the petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this court
seeking the following relief:

“For these and other grounds urged at the time of hearing

is prayed that this honourable court may be kind enough to direct
the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate Adoor, Pathanamthitta
to consider and pass orders on the bail application of the

petitioner on the date of surrender itself.”

3. Considering the nature of relief sought in the petition, this
court felt that this petition can be disposed of today itself, after
hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Public Prosecutor.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that if the
 201SKERN7R2

(CALM.C.2547/2015 3

petitioner surrenders before the court below, the court below will
not consider the bail application and she will be remanded to
custody and unless a direction is given from this court, her bail
application will not be considered on the same day itself.

5. The application is opposed by the leamed Public
Prosecutor.

6. Itis an admitted fact that the petitioner has been arrayed as
an accused in O.R. No.169/2013 of Excise Range, Adoor, which is
now pending as C.P. No.38/2015 on the files of Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court, Adoor. The apprehension of the petitioner
that if she surrenders before the court below and moves for bail her

bail application will not be considered and she will be remanded to

custody is, without any basis, as this court has in several matters
of this nature expressly observed that the Presiding Officers of the
Criminal courts are duty bound to consider and dispose of the bail

applications as far as possible on the date of application itself on
 201SKERN7R2

(CALM.C.2547/2015 4

their surrender. So, there is no necessity to issue any direction, as
such, as claimed in the petition, However, considering the
apprehension raised in the petition, this court feels that this petition
can be disposed of as follows.

If the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court, Adoor and moves for bail in C.P, No.38 of
2015 (O.R. No.169 of 2013 of Excise Range, Adoor), the learned
Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the bail

application as far as possible, on the date of application itself after

hearing the Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of the case, in
accordance with law.
With the said observations and directions, this Crl.M.C. is
disposed of.
