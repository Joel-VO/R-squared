her child
standing at the stair case of house, TC. 43/107(2), Chithra Nivas,

Marappalam, Muttathara Village, accused Nos. 1 and 2 in furtherance of

accused persons have not assaulted her as alleged by the prosecution and she
has no grievance against the accused persons and not interested to proceed with

the case.

these points are found against the prosecution.
