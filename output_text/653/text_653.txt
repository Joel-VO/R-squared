 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Crl.M.C. No.8074 of 2015

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2016

The case of the petitioner is that the case
pending before the court below has been settled between
him and the de facto complainant. The matter involves an
offence under Section 304A IPC. This Court cannot
entertain any such settlement. It is the further case of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is
working abroad and, therefore, he could not appear before
the court below. Presently, steps are in progress against the
sureties.

2. The present request is that the petitioner may be
permitted to appear before the court below within a period of

two months from today. The court below shall consider the
 2016KERZ
CrLM.C.8074/2015

matter sympathetically as far as the sureties are concerned
and the court below shall try to abstain from proceeding with
coercive steps against the sureties til then.

CrL.M.C. is disposed of as above.

Sdi-
(B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE)
