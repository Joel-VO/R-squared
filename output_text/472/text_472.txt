Crl.M.C.No.5322 of 2016

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.345/2016 of the
Vellamunda Police Station, Wayanad District, for the offences
under Sections 511 of 384 IPC.

2. The allegation against the petitioners is that he
appeared at the bakery conducted by the defacto complainant
and demanded an amount of Rs.2,000/- by threatening the
defacto complainant that licence from the Department of
Factories and Boilers is required and if it is not taken, he would
impose a fine of Rs.1 Lakh.

3. At any stretch of imagination the offence of
extortion as defined under Section 384 IPC cannot be
attracted. At the most, it is an attempt to commit misconduct
within the meaning of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Therefore, an offence under Section 511 of Section 384 IPC is
not legally sustainable in this case. Matters being so,
Annexure-II FIR and all further proceedings based on it as

against the petitioner is liable to be quashed.
 2018KERID

(CrLM.C.N0.5322 of 2016 2
In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-II FIR
and all further proceedings based on it as against the

petitioner is hereby quashed.
