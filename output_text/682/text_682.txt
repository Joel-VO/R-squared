Cri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioner is arrayed as the sole accused in Crime
No.323/2017 of Tirur Police Station for offences punishable under
Sections 450, 376(2)(i)(n) of Indian Penal Code and Section 5(1). 6
of the POCSO Act. It was alleged by the de facto complainant,
who is a 14 year old girl, that the accused, who was a neighbour
of the de facto complainant sexually abused her. It was alleged
by her that while she had gone to the house of the accused, he
forcefully undressed her, inserted his finger into her private parts
and rubbed his private part against the private part of the girl
Pursuant to an FIS laid, crime was registered. After investigation
final report was filed. Cognizance was taken and the matter is
now pending as S.C. No.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court,
Manjeri

2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending
that the dispute with the de facto complainant was amicably
settled and that the de facto complainant has no further
grievance. To buttress that contention, learned counsel for the

petitioner relied on Annexures A5 and A6 affidavits affirmed by
 2018KERT22
(Cr M,C. No, 8387 of 2017 2

the victim as well as her mother. Learned counsel for the 2"!
respondent, who is the victim, acknowledged the due execution of

the above affidavits and submitted that she has no objection in
quashing the proceedings.

3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the
statement of the victim has been recorded and the settlement has
been reported to the Police. It was also submitted that the
petitioner is not involved in any other crime.

4. Considering the serious nature of allegations raised
against the petitioner, this Court was not inclined to quash the
criminal proceedings on the basis of an agreement between the
parties. Hence, learned counsel for the petitioner chose to argue
the matter on merits.

5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned
Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 2" respondent.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention
to the report of the Medico Legal Examination of the Survival of
the Sexual Offence dated 17.04.2017. The Doctor had physical
‘examination of the victim and found that there was no injury on

her private parts. The hymen was intact and it was noted that no
 2wisiKERT22
(Cr M,C. No, 8387 of 2017 3

injuries were seen at present though the assault allegedly
occurred about one month back. The records reveal that some of
the other witnesses who were questioned, did not refer to the
alleged sexual abuse. In the nature of evidence gathered, the
prosecution has to rely essentially on the oral testimony of the
victim. However, it seems that the victim was examined before
the Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. A copy of Section 164
Cr.P.C. statement has been produced by the petitioner. In the
course of examination, specific question was put to the victim
regarding the complaint against the petitioner herein. She
feigned ignorance. She stated that the petitioner herein was
looking after the family affairs of the de facto complainant. She
feigned ignorance regarding the complaint laid to the Police
against the accused. She could not state as to who has given the
complaint against the accused. A perusal of the above statement
discloses that the accused has not stated anything touching upon
the serious allegations made in the Fl statement. Evidently, in her
Section 164 Cr.P.C, statement she has not given any incriminating
statement touching upon the sexual abuse.

7. It is evident that, in the light of a claimed settlement,
 2wisiKERT22
CF. M.C. No, 8387 of 2017 4
the possibility of the victim supporting the prosecution case is
exceptionally remote. The quality of evidence gathered by the
prosecution is such that there is no chance for a successful
prosecution of the crime. Having considered these, | feel that
continuance of the proceedings is not likely to serve any fruitful
purpose.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in S.C.

No.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court, Manjeri stand quashed.
