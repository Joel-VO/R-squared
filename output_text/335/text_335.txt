P.UBAID, J.

Crl. M.C No.2626 of 2015

Dated this the 5" day of May, 2015.
ORDER

The petitioner herein seeks orders quashing a prosecution
involving the offence under Section 379 IPC, on the ground of
amicable settlement. The offence is well compoundable under
the law. It is not known why the petitioner approached this
vacation court, when the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction
will have sitting on all days in a week. The parties can very
well approach the learned Magistrate for composition under
Section 320 Cr.P.C.
With these observations this Crl.M.C is closed.
