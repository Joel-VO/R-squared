ORDER

Petitioners are the accused Nos. to 3 in
C.C.No.1386/2014 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam. The above
case was initiated on the basis of a private complaint
filed by the second respondent as CMP No.1740/2014.
‘The second respondent is the de facto complainant in
the above case. After taking cognizance under Section
190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all the disputes
between the petitioners and the second respondent
were settled in the mediation held at the District
Mediation Centre, Ernakulam. As per the terms of
mediation, both parties agreed to withdraw all the
cases filed by both against each other before all
courts. Now the second respondent has no subsisting
grievance against the petitioners and she do not

intend to proceed with the criminal case. That apart.
 201SKERIITISS
CAM.C219914-6

the first petitioner and the second respondents
resumed their marital relationship and now living as
husband and wife peacefully. Under the above
circumstances, this petition is filed under Section
482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the entire proceedings.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,
the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel
for the second respondent. Both the counsel urged for
quashing the entire proceedings under Annexure-Al
complaint invoking inherent jurisdiction under

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

‘The learned counsel for the petitioners drew
my attention to the decision laid down by the Apex
Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108
(SC)] in support of his arguments.

4. I have meticulously considered the decision
laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT
108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the
Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question

whether the High Court has power to quash criminal
 201SKERIITISS
CAM.C219914-6

proceedings involving non—compoundable offences on
the basis of the compromise reached between the

offender and the victim and answered as given belo’

“87. The position that emerges from the
above discussion can be summarised thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a
criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in
exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
distinct and different from the power given
to a criminal court for compounding the
offences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent
power is of wide plenitude with no statutory
limitation but it has to be exercised in
accord with the guideline engrafted in such
power vizi(i) to secure the ends of justice or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court. In what cases power to quash the
criminal proceeding or complaint or F.LR.
may be exercised where the offender and
victim have settled their dispute would
depend on the facts and circumstances of
each case and no category can be prescribed.
However, before exercise of such power. the
High Court must have due regard to the
nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and
serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity. etc.,
cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
victim or victim's family and the offender
have settled the dispute. Such offences are
not private in nature and have serious
impact on society. Similarly, any
compromise between the victim and offender
in relation to the offences under special
statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act
or the offences committed by public
servants while working in that capacity etc:
cannot provide for any basis for quashing
 201SKERIITISS
CAM.C219914-6

criminal proceedings involving _ such
offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil
flavour stand on different footing for the
purposes of quashing, particularly the
offences arising from commercial. financial,
mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
transactions or the offences arising out of
matrimony relating to dowry. etc.. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically
private or personal in nature and the parties
have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, High Court may quash
criminal proceedings if in its view. because
of the compromise between the offender and
victim, the possibility of conviction is
remote, bleak and continuation of criminal
case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be
caused to him by not quashing the criminal
case despite full and complete settlement
and compromise with the victim. In other
words, the High Court must consider whether
it would be unfair or contrary to the
interest of justice to continue with the
criminal proceeding or continuation of the
criminal proceeding would tantamount to
abuse of process of law despite settlement
and compromise between the victim and
wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
justice, it is appropriate that criminal case
is put to an end and if the answer to the
above question(s) is in affirmative, the High
Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
quash the criminal proceeding.”

5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the
question to be considered, in the instant case, is,

whether the non-compoundable offence involved in
 201SKERIITISS
CAM.C219914-6

this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the
inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the
offences alleged against the petitioners will not
come under the category of non-compoundable
offences, which are specifically excluded from
composition, in the exercise of inherent power under
Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by
the de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute
between the accused and the victim had been amicably
settled and at present the de facto complainant has
no subsisting grievance at all. The de facto
complainant does not want to proceed with
prosecution against the accused. Full and final
settlement and compromise with the victim are
evidenced by Annexure-A3. In view of the compromise
between the first petitioner and the victim, I find
that the possibility of conviction is remote, bleak,
and continuation of the criminal case would put the

parties to great oppression, prejudice and also
 201SKERIITISS
CAM.C219914-6

tantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The
present criminal prosecution against the accused
must be put to an end to secure the interest of
justice.

6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings
against the petitioners under Annexure~Al complaint
in C.C, No.1386/2014 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam will stand
quashed.

This petition is allowed.
