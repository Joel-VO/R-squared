ORDER

The petitioner is the second accused in C.C.No.175 of
2009 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,
Thiruvananthapuram. Based on Annexure-A final report in
Crime No.275 of 1996 of Valiyathura Police Station for the
offences punishable and Section 465, 468, 471 IPC r/w Section
34 IPC and Section 12 (1) (b) r/w Section 3 of the Passport
‘Act, 1967.

2. According to the petitioner, the first accused had
done the entire acts, and he had pleaded guilty before the
court below, and thereby he was convicted and sentenced.
Further, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner,
when the first accused has been convicted and sentenced, the
continued prosecution of the petitioner in C.C.No.175 of 2009
is quite unnecessary.

3. The arguments forwarded by the learned counsel for
 2017KERISSS
CCrLM.C. No.6938 of 2017

2
the petitioner that the offences alleged against the petitioner
are not legally sustainable against the petitioner, does not
seem to be correct. If the allegations are true, it may invite
the offences alleged. The present stage is to premature to
conclude that the petitioner has not committed the offences
alleged against him. Being an old matter, the court below
shall take up the matter out of turn and shall dispose it of,
expeditiously, at any rate within a period of six months from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

With the said direction, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.
