The petitioners are the two accused in Crime No.49 of
2017 of the Excise Enforcement and Anti Narcotic Special Squad,
Palakkad. By order dated 03.01.2018 in Crl.M.C.No.3397 of 2017,
they were granted bail by the Court of Session, Palakkad on
conditions. One of the conditions is that they shall deposit a sum

of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each as security. The

petitioners are aggrieved by the sai

found possessing 6 Kgs of ganja at about 5.30 p.m. on
30.10.2017. The antecedents of the petitioners are being probed
into. 1 am not inclined to lift the condition as such as requested by
