P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.6746 of 2014

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner herein is aggrieved by the
conditions imposed by the learned Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Malappuram for release of his vehicle under Section
457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. %1,50,000/- was assessed
as the total value of the vehicle during the proceeding. He is
directed by the learned Magistrate to execute a bond for %
1,50,000/- with two solvent sureties, to make deposit of %
45,000/- in court, and also to produce bank guarantee for the
balance amount of  %1,05,000/-. He is aggrieved by the
conditions directing production of bank guarantee and cash
deposit. It appears that the latest decision of this Court on the
point has not come to the notice of the learned Magistrate. This
Court has settled that in such cases the conditions imposed
under Section 451 Cr.P.C shall not be irrational.

2. On a consideration of the facts and
circumstances, I feel that the third condition directing

production of bank guarantee can be set aside, because the other
 201SKERIII73

(CHM No.6746 of 2014 2
conditions will serve the purpose. As regards the other
conditions, I do not find any scope for interference.

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
allowed in part. The third condition imposed by the court below
as per order dated 11.11.2014 in C.M.P No.9557/2014 directing

the petitioner to produce bank guarantee will stand set aside.
