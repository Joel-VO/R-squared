Crl.M.C No.10 of 2015

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the four accused in
C.C No.278/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Malappuram. Crime in the said case was registered under
Sections 341, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, on
the complaint of one Suhail. The petitioners now seek orders
quashing the prosecution as against them on the ground that
they and the defacto complainant have amicably settled the
dispute out of court. The defacto complainant Suhail is the
second respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to
the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused,
and he has no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied
that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties,
and I find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will
not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of
the court. Nobody will support the prosecution if the case

against the petitioners goes to trial.

CALM No.10 0f 2015 2

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C
'No.278/2014 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Malappuram, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand
released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by

them will stand discharged.
