Crl.M.C.No.7769 of 2017

Dated this the 6" day of December, 2017
ORDER

The sole accused in C.C.No.214 of 2017 of Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam arising from Crime No411
of 2017 of Koothattukulam Police Station is the petitioner herein.

2. The second respondent is the de facto complainant, who
alleged that, on 19.03.2017 at 12.30p.m., petitioner herein uttered
obscene words and kicked on the abdomen of the de facto
complainant, who is the wife of the accused. Complaint was laid
and after investigation, final report was filed.

3. Petitioner has approached this Court invoking section
482 Cr.P.C contending that the matrimonial disputes have now been
resolved between the parties and no further grievance survives. To
substantiate it, learned counsel for the petitioner relied on
Annexure-B affidavit stated to be affirmed by the second
respondent/de facto complainant. It was submitted by the learned
counsel for the second respondent that Annexure-B was affirmed by
the second respondent and that, pursuant to the settlement between
the parties, a joint application for divorce is pending. It was also

submitted that, she has no objection in quashing the proceedings.

4, Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the matter has
been reported to be settled. Having regard to these facts, I am
inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr-P.C to quash
the entire proceedings to meet the ends of justice.

In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
in C.C.No.214 of 2017 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Koothattukulam arising from Crime No411 of 2017 of
Koothattukulam Police Station will stand quashed.
