This case having been heard today, the court delivered the following:
JUDGMENT

This case was instituted on the basis of a complaint filed by the
Inspector, Railway Protection Force, Thiruvananthpauram Central against
the accused alleging the commission of the offence punishable under
section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966.

2. The complainant's case in brief is as follows:- ‘That at around
08.30 hours on 14.03.2024, the 1st accused dishonestly taken away the

railway properties i.e., 21 numbers of railway pandrol clips valued

Rs.2100/- and the 2nd accused dishonestly taken away 82 numbers of
pandrol clips valued Rs.8200/- from the Railway Material stockyard near
Killippalam. Thereby the accused committed the offence punishable
under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,
1966.

3. The accused were arrested and produced before the court.
They were remanded to the judicial custody, Subsequently they were
enlarged on bail.

4, Cognizance was taken for the offence punishable under
section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 on
the basis of the complaint filed by the Inspector of Railway Protection
Force, Thiruvananthapuram Central. Summons was served on the
accused. They appeared before the court. The 2nd accused filed an
application expressing her readiness to plead guilty, even before recording
the pre-charge evidence. The complaint and the records annexed to it were
perused. I am satisfied that there are materials to frame charge for the
offence punishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful
Possession) Act, 1966, Hence the charge for the offence punishable under
section 3(a) of Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 Act
was framed, read over and explained to the 2nd accused in Malayalam, to
which the 2nd accused pleaded guilty.

5, Lam satisfied that the 2nd accused pleaded guilty voluntarily,
fully knowing the consequences of pleading guilty. Therefore the plea of
guilt is accepted. The 2nd accused is found guilty of the offence
punishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful
Possession) Act, 1966 and hence she is convicted thereunder. Having
regard to the facts and circumstance of the case, I am of the view that this
is not a fit case to invoke the benevolent provisions of the Probation of
Offenders Act.

6. Heard the 2nd accused regarding the question of sentence
She pleaded for leniency. The accused has no criminal antecedents. The
accused had already undergone custody for a period of 5 days. Even the
 4

prosecution has no case that there was any premeditated intention on the
part of the accused in the commission of the offence. Having regard to
the nature of offence and the value of the property involved and the age
of the accused, I am of the view that imprisonment for not less than one
year is not warranted in this case.

In the result, the 2nd accused is convicted and sentenced under
section 269(3) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 to
undergo simple imprisonment for 5 days and to pay fine of Rs.2000/-
(two thousand rupees) for the offence punishable under section 3(a) of
the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, In default of
payment of fine the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for 5
days. Set off is allowed under section 297 of the Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 for the period of detention already undergone by
the 2nd accused in judi ., from 15/03/2024 to 19/03/2024.
‘The case against the 1st accused is refiled as CC No.536/2024.
