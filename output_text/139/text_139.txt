Crl.M.C. No. 137 of 2015

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the original 3" accused in crime No.
278/04 of the Tanur Police Station registered under Sections
323, 324 and 308 IPC. The said crime was registered on the
complaint of one Razak. The accused Nos. 1 and 2 faced trial
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge Fast Track Court
No.III (Adhoc), Manjeri, in S.C.No. 153/2006, and obtained a
judgment of acquittal on 23.01.2008 under Section 232 Cr.P.C.,
when all the material witnesses turned hostile during trial. The
case against the petitioner herein was split up and refiled when
he consistently remained absent during the process. It is now
pending as S.C.No.413/2014 before the learned Assistant
Sessions Judge, Tirur. The petitioner now seeks orders quashing
the prosecution, on the ground that in the above circumstances
of acquittal of the others in view of an amicable settlement,
continuance of prosecution as against him will not serve any

purpose. Annexure-B judgment of the trial court in
 201SKERIIOMS

CAME. Na 170018 2
S.C.No.153/06 shows that in the said case where the accused
Nos. 1 and 2 faced trial, the prosecution examined five witnesses
including the first informant, Razak, and marked Ext.P1. None of
the material witnesses supported the prosecution. The judgment
also shows that all the witnesses turned hostile in view of an
amicable settlement made between the parties out of court. In
such a situation where there is no possibility of any of the
witnesses supporting the prosecution, and the prosecution cannot
in any manner improve the case when case goes to trial,
continuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste of time.

In the result, this Cri.M.c.

allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioner in S.C.No.413/14 before the learned
Assistant Sessions Judge, Tirur, will stand quashed under Section
482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from
prosecution. The bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand
discharged.
