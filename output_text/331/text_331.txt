Crl.M.C. No.2608 of 2015

Dated this the 28" day of April 2015

ORDER

Petitioner is arrayed as the first accused in Crime
'No.401/2011 of Ettumanoor Police Station, which is pending as
C.C.No.439 of 2014 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Ettumanoor, registered for the offence punishable under
Section 420 r/w 34 of IPC. The grievance of the petitioner is that,
the Magistrate Court has already issued non-bailable warrant
against him and if he surrenders before the Magistrate Court
there is likelihood of the application not being considered on the
very same day. Hence, he has filed this Crl.M.C. seeking an order
directing the Magistrate Court to consider and pass appropriate
orders on his bail application on the day of surrender itself.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor for respondent,

3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case,
this Crl.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioner to surrender

before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor
 201SKERIITAS6
CrI.M.C, No.2608 of 2015,

within two weeks from today and the Magistrate Court is further
directed to consider and pass appropriate orders on the bail
application filed by the petitioner on the same day itself, in
accordance with law. The non-bailable warrant issued against the
petitioner shall be kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks
from today.

This Cr.M.C. is disposed of.
