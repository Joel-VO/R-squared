This case finally came up for consideration and hearing on 28.11.2024 and
this Court on the 05.12.2024 delivered the following: -
JUDGEMENT.

1. This is a case instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of
Police, Thumba Police Station in Crime No. 74/2014 for the offences punishable
under Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the prior animosity
towards the Informant, all the three Accused persons, in furtherance of their

common intention to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the Informant, assaulted
him on 19.01.2014 at 9.30 pm at , Kulathoor, Attipra. The 1" and 2" Accused came
in some motor cycle, stopped the same in front of the Informant and the 1*
Accused punched the Informant below his right eye and also on his right cheek
‘with a piece of granite stone lying on the road, thereby causing fracture on right
maxilla and right zygoma. Thereafter, the 3 Accused along with the others had
restrained him wrongfully, and the 3% Accused heavily hit on his chest with a
granite stone piece lying on the road. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have
‘committed the above mentioned offences.

3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the
offences under Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the IPC. The summons was issued
only to the 3" Accused as the 1and 2“ Accused were reported to be no more in
the Final Report itself. On issuance of process, the 3% Accused entered

 appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own
choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to him. After
hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge framed for the
offences punishable under Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the IPC and the same
‘was read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to
be tried,

4. From the side of Prosecution CWs1 to 4 were examined as PWs1 to 4
respectively. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the
material witnesses had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no
incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the
‘examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed
with, No Defence evidence was adduced,

5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for
consideration.

(a) Has the 3 Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance of their
common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with granite stone piece
and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 324 r/w 34 of
the IPC as alleged

(b) Has the 3% Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance
of their common intention, wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby
‘committed offence punishable under Section 342 of the IPC as alleged?

(©) Has the 3° Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance of
their common intention, voluntarily caused grievous hurt to PW1, resulting
in him sustaining fracture and thereby committed the offence punishable
under section 326 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?

(a) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?
 4

6. Points (a) to (©): These points are considered together for the sake of
brevity and for avoiding repetition.

PWI deposed that he knows the incident. He doesn’t remember the date of
occurrence, And that it was on 2016 at Kulathoor, Ambalamukku about 6.30 pm,
‘Two persons, whom he does not remember attempted to assault him. They did not
stole his ormamentsHe could not identify the Accused persons. He denied having
given statement to the police to the effect that he sustained injury in the incident

‘and that his jewellery was stolen,

PWs2, 3 and 4 deposed that they know PW1, but denied having witnessed the
incident and to have given statement to the police to that effect.

have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the
materials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured himself is having
no complaint or allegations that the 3" Accused had voluntarily cause grevious
hurt to him. In fact, according to him two persons whom he does not remember
had attacked him. No such injury as alleged by the Prosecution is deposed to by
the Informant. The occurrence witnesses also denied the case of the Prosecution.
‘The remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be
served in examining the remaining witness, when the Injured himself has no case
supporting the Prosecution.

‘On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on
record, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 itself that there is no evidence to
‘support the Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are
made out from the evidence adduced. There is nothing available on record to
implicate the 3° Accused to the above incident. Hence, on a total consideration of
facts and circumstances of the above case and on appreciation of the evidence
adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against
the 3* Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the 3"
Accused.
 7. Point (@); In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not
arise for consideration.

In the result, the 3" Accused is found not guilty of having committed the
offences punishable under Sections 324, 342, 326r/w 34 of the IPC. He is acquitted
of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands
cancelled and he is set at liberty.
