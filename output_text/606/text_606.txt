Crl.M.C.No.7382 of 2016

Dated this the 6” day of January, 2017

ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is the first accused in SC No.1334/2010,
now pending as L.P.No.13/2014 of the VI Additional Sessions Court,
Kollam for offences punishable under sections 143,147,148,323 and
308 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Kerala(Prevention) of Ragging
Act.

2. The petitioner herein along with nine other persons stood
charge sheeted for offences punishable under the above provisions
of law. All the accused except the petitioner herein faced the trial.
By Annexure A2 Judgment, all the accused who faced the trial were
acquitted on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove the
allegation against the accused. The case against the petitioner
herein was split up and re-filed. Since the accused again remained
absent, it was relegated to the LP Register.

3. The petitioner has now approached this court contending
that the matter has been settled between the parties, that in the
light of Annexure A2 judgment, the substratum of the case is
broken and that benefit should enure to him also. It was further
submitted that the dispute has also been settled between the

parties as is evident from Annexure A3 affidavit filed by the second
 217KERZOS
CHLM.C.No.73822016

respondent.

4, Learned counsel for the second respondent relying on
Annexure A3 affidavit, submitted that the matter has been settled.

5. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submitted that
the petitioner is not involved in any other crime and that the
dispute has been resolved.

6. In the light of the above, I am satisfied that no purpose will
be served at this length of time by proceeding against the
petitioner herein. Having considered these facts in detail, I find
that interest of justice demands,all the further proceedings against
the petitioner should stand quashed.

In the result, the Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings
pursuant to SC No.1334/2010 now pending as LP No.13/2014 of
the VI Additional Sessions Court, Kollam arising from crime

NO.664/2004 of Kollam East Police Station stand quashed.
