Crl.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016

Dated 4" October, 2016

1 This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (for short “the Code”) has been preferred by
the petitioners herein, who are the accused Nos. 1 and 2
in Crime No. 1426 of 2016 of the Perinthalmanna Police
Station. The aforesaid crime has been registered for
offences punishable under Section 3 and 4 of the Kerala
Prohibition of Ragging Act, 1998. The 2 respondent is
the de facto complainant.

2. The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on
13.11.2015 at about 11.45 am, the petitioners had
subjected the 2~ respondent to ragging inside the
premises of the PTM Govt. College, Perinthalmanna.

3.The 2 respondent has entered appearance through the
counsel and has filed Annexure-B affidavit wherein he

asserts that he does not wish that the criminal

 2016KERIAI6
FLMC. No, $563 of 2016 2

proceedings against the petitioners should continue. The
learned counsel appearing for the 2 respondent/ de facto
complainant would invite the attention of this court to
Annexure-A, complaint filed by him before the Prinicipal of
the College. According to him, he had only complained
that the petitioners had asked him not to wear trousers
which drooped down from his waist and branded footwear.
According to the 2% respondent, the disputes have been
amicably resolved and he does not wish the criminal
proceedings as against the petitioners should continue any
further.

4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits
that in view of the settlement arrived at between the
parties, this Court will be justified in quashing the
proceedings.

5.The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions
has expressed his reservations in the matter of quashing
the proceedings on the basis of settlement. It is

submitted that the invocation of powers under Section 482
 2016KERIAI6
FLMC. No, $563 of 2016 3

of the Code in a case of this nature is not warranted.
However, it is submitted that no other cases are reported
against the petitioners.

6.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another (2012
(10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position
in respect of the powers vested in the High Court under
$.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal
proceedings. It was held that the power vested in the High
Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code,
is not limited to quashing proceedings within the ambit
and scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. The three - Judge Bench in the above case,

clearly expounded, that quashing of cri

inal proceedings
under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be
based on settlements between private parties, and could
also on a compromise between the offender and the
victim. Only that, the above power did not extend to
crimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention,

that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under
 2016KERIAI6
FLMC. No, $563 of 2016 4

Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing
criminal proceedings, was held to be exercisable in
criminal cases having an overwhelming and
predominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising
from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership,
or such like transactions. Further, guidelines were issued
by the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of
Punjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh
Kamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others
[AIR 2016 SC 2452].

7.1 have considered the rival submissions and I have gone
through the materials on record. The offence committed

by the pe!

ioners cannot be said to be grave and serious
having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also
does not appear that the offence in this case will have a
serious impact on the society. More over, when the
respondent No.2 has settled the matter, the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the

criminal case against the petitioners would be a futile
 2016KERIAI6
FLMC. No, $563 of 2016 5

exercise. It would also put the petitioners and the 2
respondent to great oppression and prejudice.
8.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of
the considered view that this Court will be well justified in
invoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of
the Code to quash the proceedings.
In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A
FIR in Crime No. 1426 of 2015 of the Perinthalmanna Police
Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the

petitioners are quashed.
