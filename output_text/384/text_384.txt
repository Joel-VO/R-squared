THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 Czl.MC.Wo. 4091 OF 2020(B) 23. aozumenrss

ORDER

Dated this the 6th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.574-
2008 registered at the Edachery Police Station for
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,
341, 323, 324 and 308 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as
S.C.No.842/2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions
Court, Vadakara. As per Annexure-2 judgment, all
accused except the petitioners were acquitted. The
case against the petitioners was split up and refiled
as S.C.No.842/2018. The de facto complainant, at
whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed
as the 2 respondent. Annexure-3 affidavit has been
filed by 2" respondent stating that the reason for the
incident, which led to registration of the crime, has

been resolved amicably, in view of the settlement and
 Czl.MC.Wo. 4091 OF 2020(B) whee aozumenrss

he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who,
on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no
criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavit filed by the 2° respondent, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and
no public interest is involved in this matter. The fact
that the accused Nos. 2 to 6 were acquitted after trial
as evident by Annexure-2 judgment and the further
fact that the dispute has been dissolved between the
parties is also taken into consideration. Moreover, in
view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal
proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such,

continuance of the proceedings will amount to an
 Ce1.MC.No. 4091 OF 2020(B) Se

abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme
Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab
[(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of
Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303}, there is
no impediment in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Cr.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in S.C.No.842/2018 on the files of the

Assistant Sessions Court, Vadakara is quashed.
