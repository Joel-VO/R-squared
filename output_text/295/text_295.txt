CrL.M.C. No.2254 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioners are the accused Nos.1 and 2 in
C.C.No.1096/2014 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kannur, arising out of
Crime No.164/2014 of Kannur City Police. The offences
alleged against the petitioners are punishable under
Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code. The second respondent is the wife of the first
petitioner and the second petitioner is the mother of
the first petitioner. The marital discordancy between
the first petitioner and the de facto complainant
culminated in criminal prosecution for the offence
punishable under Section 498A of the IPC and
Annexure-A final report has been filed before the
trial court. Now the said case is pending for trial.

2. In this CrL.M.C., it is stated that the parties
 201SKERTISS
CHLM.C.2254/15-B a:

have settled the matter out of court and now they are
residing under the same roof and the second
respondent has sworn to an affidavit stating the
factum of compromise. As non-compoundable
offences are incorporated, even though the parties
have settled their dispute amicably, the criminal
proceedings cannot be put to an end. In such
circumstance, the petitioners filed this Crl.M.C.
seeking an order quashing the entire criminal
prosecution under Annexure~A final report, invoking
the inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, in view of the decision laid down
by the Apex Court in Gian Singh V. State of Punjab [2012
(4) KLT 108 (SC)].

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,
the learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel
for the second respondent.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioners drew

my attention to the proposition laid down by the Apex
 201SKERTISS
CHLM.C.2254/15-B 3

Court in the above decision, which permitted the High
Court to compound a non-compoundable offence in
exercise of the inherent jurisdiction and power under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The learned counsel for the
second respondent submits that what is stated in the
affidavit is true to the best of his knowledge and
belief and now the second respondent does not want to
proceed with the prosecution against the petitioners
and both the counsel appearing for the respective
parties urged for quashing the proceedings in
exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Cr.P.c.

5. I have meticulously considered the decision
laid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT
108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the
Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question
whether the High Court has power to quash criminal
proceedings involving non—compoundable offences on

the basis of the compromise reached between the
 201SKERII72SS
CAM.C225415.B

offender and the victim and answered as given below:

*57, ‘The position that emerges from the above
discussion can be summarised thus, the power of the
High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
distinct and different from the power given to a criminal
court for compounding the offences under 8.320 of the
Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no
statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
with the guideline engrafted in such power vizs(i) to
secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court, In what cases power to quash the
criminal proceeding or complaint or FLR. may be
exercised where the offender and victim have settled
their dispute would depend on the facts and
circumstances of each case and no category can be
prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the
High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime, Heinous and serious offences of
mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
or victim’s family and the offender have settled the
dispute, Such offences are not private in nature and
have serious impact on society. Similarly. any
compromise between the victim and offender in relation
to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of
Corruption Act or the offences committed by public
servants while working in that capacity etc;

‘im

cannot
 201SKERII72SS
CAM.C225415.B

provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings
involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour
stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing.
particularly the offences arising from commercial,

financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like
rising out of matrimony
where the
personal in nature and the

transactions or the offenc
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disput
wrong is basically private
parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
between the offender and victim, the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of

criminal case would put accused to great oppression and
prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him
by not quashing the criminal case despite full and
complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In
other words, the High Court must consider whether it
would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation
of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse
of process of law despite settlement and compromise
between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to

secure the ends of justice itis appropriate that criminal

the answer to the above

case is put to an end and
question(s) isin affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.”

6. In view of the proposition laid down above, the
question to be considered, in the instant case, is,
whether the non-compoundable offence involved in
this case can be compounded, in the exercise of the
inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the
offences alleged against the petitioners will not
come under the category of non-compoundable
offences, which are specifically excluded from
composition, in the exercise of inherent power under
Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by
the de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute
between the accused and the victim had been amicably
settled and at present the de facto complainant has
no subsisting grievance at all. The de facto
complainant does not want to proceed with
prosecution against the accused. Full and final
settlement and compromise with the victim are

evidenced by Annexure-B. In view of the compromise
 201SKERTISS
CHLM.C.2254/15-B BA

between the petitioners and the victim, I find that the
possibility of conviction is remote, bleak, and
continuation of the criminal case would put the
parties to great oppression, prejudice and also
tantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The
present criminal prosecution against the accused
must be put to an end to secure the interest of
justice.

7. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings
against the petitioners under Annexure~A final
report will stand quashed in the exercise of
jurisdiction and power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

This petition is allowed.
