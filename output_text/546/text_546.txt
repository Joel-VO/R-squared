Crl.M.C. No.6328 of 2016

Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018

The petitioner was working as Receptionist at the
laboratory being conducted by the de facto complainant in
the name and style as “Hitech Diagnostic Centre”. It is
alleged that while working so, the petitioner had borrowed
‘an amount of &2 lakhs from the de facto complainant for the
marriage of the daughter of the petitioner, on an undertaking
that the amount would be returned by way of instalments at
the rate of 1,500/- per month. The said amount was not
returned. Over and above it, during the period in which she

was working as Receptionist, she had obtained amounts
 (C.M.C.6328/2016

from the customers and had not entered an amount of
%6,000/- received from the customers in the computer and
therefore, she misappropriated an amount of %6,000/-.

2. Regarding the amount of %2 lakhs allegedly
borrowed, the liability is purely civil in nature, even if there is
such a liability. Regarding the other matter relating to
%6,000/-, it seems that the prosecution has not produced
any evidence to show that any of the customers had paid
the said amount of %6,000/-. There is absolutely nothing to
show that the said amount of %6,000/- was received by the
petitioner and the same was not entered in the computer.

3. Matters being so, the prosecution of the petitioner
in CC.165/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court-IX, Kunnumpuram, Ernakulam is quite unnecessary
and therefore, Annexure-A1 final report and all further

proceedings in it are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
 (C.M.C.6328/2016

proceedings against the petitioner in CC.165/2016 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-IX, Kunnumpuram,
Ernakulam, which has arisen from Crime No.1437/2010 of

the Palarivattom Police Station, are quashed.
