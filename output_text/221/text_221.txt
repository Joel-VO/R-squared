THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 2024KERAISS

CrL.M.C. No.386 of 2024

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioner challenges condition No.2 in the order dated
23.12.2023 of the Additional Sessions Court, Palakkad.

2. Petitioner is involved in an offence punishable under Section
20(bMiiXB) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
Act, 1985 [for short, ‘NDPS Act]. Prosecution alleged that the
petitioner was found in illegal possession of 1.990 Kgs. of
ganja, and he was arrested on 11.10.2023.

3. On 23.12.2023, the learned Session Judge granted him bail but
imposed a condition that one of the sureties must be the parent
or near relative of the petitioner, and further that they shall
produce the original title deed to prove that he or she is
solvent. Of course, it was specified that the original title deed
would be retumed after verifying it with the photocopy.

4, Adv.Subi.K., the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted
 2024KERAISS

that the parents or near relatives of the petitioner are not
solvent, and therefore, they cannot produce the original title
deed to prove their solvency. It was further submitted that the
insistence on one of the sureties to be a parent or a near
relative is prejudicial and renders the order granting bail
practically impossible to comply with. It was submitted that
due to the inability to comply with the said condition,
petitioner continues to remain in jail even today, and unless
the said condition is deleted, the petitioner would be

prejudiced.

. SrLAShi.M.C., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the
deletion of the said condition and submitted that the same is
reasonable and even necessary, since the offence committed by
the petitioner is under the NDPS Act.

- Conditions in an order granting bail cannot be too onerous or

incapable of performance. Insisting on sureties is only a means

to ensure that the accused will appear during trial. Even if the
surety is not a parent or a near relative, if in case the

petitioner absconds, proceedings can be initiated against the
 2024KERAISS

surety. In fact, the conditions imposed in the instant case do
stipulate the petitioner to surrender his passport. Therefore,

the insistence on the parent or near relative being a surety for

the grant of bail is not a reasonable condition in the present
scenario, especially when the petitioner contends that his
parents and near relatives are not solvent.

Since the petitioner asserts that his parents and near relatives
are not solvent, the condition directing one of the sureties to
be his parent or a near relative, is too onerous in the peculiar
circumstances of the case. However, in order to ensure the

availability of the petitioner and to ensure his presence, the

condition to be deleted ought to be substituted with another
condition that he shall file an undertaking in the form of an
affidavit providing his mobile phone number and an
undertaking that he will not change the said number until
conclusion of trial.

. Therefore, condition No.2 in the order dated 23.12,2023 in
Crl.M.P.No.6435/2023. on the files of the Additional Sessions

Court, Palakkad shall stand deleted and it will be substituted
 2024KERAISS

with the following condition:
“2, Petitioner shall file an affidavit providing his
mobile phone number and an undertaking that the

said number shall not be changed until conclusion

of trial.”
‘The Crl.M.C.is allowed as above.
