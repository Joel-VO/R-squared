ORDER

The petitioners are arrayed as the accused Nos.1
and 2 in CC.No.640/2017 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, arising from Crime
No.126/2009 of Pazhayangadi Police Station for offences
punishable under sections 143, 147, 448, 427 read with
section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. It was alleged by the prosecution that on
18.5.2009 at 10.15 pm, the petitioners formed into an
unlawful assembly along with 10 other persons and
trespassed into the office and demolished furnitures.
Complaint was laid and crime was registered. After
investigation, final report was laid and the matter was
taken cognizance of as CC.No.568/2009. It appears that
the third accused alone faced the trial. He was acquitted
by Annexure-A3 judgment. The case against the
petitioners herein was split up and refiled as

CC.No.640/2017.

3. The petitioners have approached this court
contending that in the light of the acquittal of the co-
accused, the substratum of the case is broken and the
prosecution of the petitioner is not sustainable. It was
also contended that the dispute has now been settled with
the defacto complainant. To substantiate it, the learned
counsel for the petitioners relied on Annexure-A4, which
is stated to be affirmed by the defacto complainant, who
is arrayed as the second respondent. The learned counsel
for the second respondent submitted that the matter has
been settled and he has no objection in quashing the
proceedings. The learned Public prosecutor on
instructions submitted that Annexure-A3 judgment was
not challenged in any other proceedings and that the
petitioners are not involved in any other case. Evidently,
‘Annexure-A3 judgment has become final. A perusal of
the judgment shows that the court, after evaluation of the
available materials acquitted the third accused.

4. Hence, there is no scope for a successful
 2018KERAS

Cri.M.C.No.8780 of 2017

prosecution of the petitioners herein. Evidently the
parties have also settled the dispute. They are not
involved in any other crime. Having considered these
facts, I feel that the interest of justice demands the
quashing of the entire proceedings. Hence Cri.M.C is liable
to be allowed.

5. However, it is pertinent to note that though the
crime is of the year 2009, the petitioners herein remained
elusive and did not participate in the judicial proceedings.
The case against them was split up and refiled. This has
caused considerable delay in the judicial proceedings.
Having considered this, I am inclined to invoke the
jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C only subject to
payment of cost by each of the petitioner. Hence Crl.M.C
will stand allowed and all further proceedings in
CC.No.640/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Payyannur arising from Crime
No.126/2009 of Pazhayangadi Police Station as against

the petitioners herein will stand quashed on condition that

each of the petitioner deposits a sum of Rs.1500/- to the
Kerala State Mediation and Conciliation Committee, High
Court of Kerala, Ernakulam, within one month from today

and produce proof, before this court.
