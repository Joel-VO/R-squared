ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January, 2020

The petitioner is the 3° accused in Crime No.102 of 2002
of Thirurangadi Police Station, Malappuram district for having
allegedly committed offences punishable under Section 395 and
120 [B] of IPC. There were three other accused. The petitioner
was absconding and the case against him was split up while trial
proceeded against Al, A2 and A4 in S.C 142 of 2010. Vide
judgment at Annexure - III dated 29/8/2013, the Sessions Court,
Manjeri found the accused who faced the trial not guilty and
acquitted them. A discussion of the evidence indicate that there is
absolutely no evidence regarding the involvment of the accused
who faced trial as also the others. PW1 could not let it any criminal
evidence regarding the involvment of the accused. No purpose
would therefore be served by proceeding with the trial as against
the petitioner. A report has been obtained from the Investigating
Officer through the Senior Public Prosecutor. The judgment at
Annexure-A3 has become final. Proceeding with the trial as against
the petitioner would only amount to exercising futility and wastage

of judicial time.
 Cel.MC.No.8777 OF 2019(F)

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed and the entire
proceedings as against the petitioner pending before the Additional
District and Sessions Court-II, Manjeri as S.C 142 of 2010 stands

quashed under Section 482 Cr-P.C and the accused is discharged.
