ORDER

Dated this the 9th day of January 2020

The petitioner is the 1* accused in C.C.No.467/2012
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-I, Kochi. There were two accused. The 2"
accused had approached this court in
Crl.M.C.No.5542/2014 to quash the proceedings against
him in the very same case. The complaint filed by the
1* respondent was referred by the Police, against which
he filed a protest complaint and that has been taken on
file by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1,
Kochi and is presently pending as C.C.No.467/2012. The
allegation in the complaint is that the 2™ accused had
under the instigation of the 1" accused; forged and
produced a document before the Cochin Devaswom Board to
lay a claim over the Temple. After considering the
entire materials available, this Court by a detailed
Order dated 07.06.2019 at | Annexure X quashed the
proceedings as against the 2™ accused. The offences

alleged against the petitioner are under Sections 415,
 No. 4208 of 2019 2020KERNON

465, 468 and 474 of I.P.C. There is also a civil suit
pending against the 2™ accused. The dispute revolves
around the title over the Temple and its properties.
The discussions in Annexure X order would equally apply
to the petitioner also, because the specific allegation
therein is that in furtherance of common intention the
accused 1 and 2 had forged documents to usurp the title
over the Temple. In view of the specific finding in
favour of the 2™ accused, the allegations as against
the 1" accused also would not lie as the role of the 1*
accused is only to instigate the 2" accused to produce
the forged document. Therefore, the entire proceedings
as against the 1* accused in C.C.No.467/2012 on the
file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Kochi, also stands quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
and the petitioner is discharged.
