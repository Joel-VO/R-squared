she deposed that when she was collecting data from a house 1-2 persons came

he hadn't witnessed the accused assaulting PW1 and according to him there
‘were a bunch of people and he is not able to say whether the accused was

present on that day

11, Analysis of evidence : Prosecution has examined only PWI and PW2. The
evidence of PW1 and PW2 itself shows that they weren’t aware of the accused

and according to PW1 she cannot recognize the accused.

12, Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor has given up the other witnesses in this
‘case and she is justified in doing so as the material witness failed to support the
prosecution case. There is nothing on record to disclose that the accused has
committed the offences as alleged by the prosecution. Having considered the
evidence on record, this court is of the view that the prosecution has failed to
prove the guilt of the accused and for the said reasons, these points are found

against the prosecution.
