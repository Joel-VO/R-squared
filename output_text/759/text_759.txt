Cr1.M.C.No. 8829 of 2017

ORDER

‘The petitioner herein stands arrayed as the sole accused in
SC No.309/2012 of the Additional District and Sessions Court,
Thalassery for offences punishable under section 302 IPC.
According to the petitioner herein, she is married and is now living
at Malappuram, which is more than 300 kms away from the court.
According to her, there was some communication gap between the
lawyer and herself, pursuant to which she could not appear before
the court below on the last posting date. Hence, non bailable
warrant was issued by the court on 14/11/2017 and notice to the
sureties ordered. The petitioner has approached this court
contending that she is ready and willing to appear before the court
below, to submit herself to the jurisdiction and to participate in all
future proceedings personally or through the counsel. Her
apprehension is that, if she appears, her application for bail is not
likely to be taken up on the same day. She further stated that, she

is only 25 years old and seeks indulgence of this court.
 2018KERD
(CAM.CNo 88292017 2

2, Having considered the entire facts and the assurance
made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner
herein shall appear before the court below on all posting dates and
co-operate with the trial, I am inclined to give one more
opportunity to the petitioner herein to surrender herself before the
court below within a period of ten days from today. If the
petitioner so surrenders before the court below and files
applications for bail and also for recalling the warrant, the court
below shall take up those applications on the date of appearance
and pass appropriate orders on the same day, having regard to the
fact that essentially the warrant is issued to ensure the presence of
the accused and the purpose will stand satisfied once the accused
appears, Warrant issued by the court below will be kept in

abeyance till the date of appearance within the period of ten days

from today.
