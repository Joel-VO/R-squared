‘This case having been heard today, the court delivered the following:-
JUDGMENT

This case was instituted on the basis of a complaint filed by the
Inspector, Railway Protection Force, Thiruvananthpauram Central, against
the accused alleging the commission of the offence punishable under
section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966.

2. The complainant's case in brief is as follows:- ‘That at around
09.00 hours on 30.10.2023, the accused dishonestly taken away the
railway properties i.e., 04 numbers of railway bolt with nut of ‘C’ clamp
each valued Rs.205/- (Total Rs.820/-) and 07 numbers of railway bolt
with nut of *C’ clamp each valued Rs.205/- (total Rs.1435/-) and one
piece of railway 60 kg rail having length of 32 cm, valued Rs.500/- and 5
numbers of railway bolt with nut of *C’ clamp valued Rs.1025/- from the
Railway Gang Rest Room, Dhanuvechapuram Railway Station, over KM
243/ 500-600. Thereby the accused committed the offence punishable
under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,
1966.

3. On 31.10.2023, the accused were arrested and produced
before the court, They were remanded to the judicial custody.
Subsequently they were enlarged on bail.

4, Cognizance was taken for the offence punishable under
section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 on
the basis of the complaint filed by the Inspector of the Railway
Protection Force, Thiruvananthapuram Central. Summons was served on
the accused. The accused appeared before the court. ‘The 1st accused
filed application expressing his readiness to plead guilty, even before
recording the pre-charge evidence. The complaint and the records
annexed to it were perused. I am satisfied that there are materials to frame
charge under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession)
Act, 1966. Hence the charge for the offence punishable under section 3(a)
of Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 Act was framed,
read over and explained to the Ist accused in Malayalam, to which the Ist
accused pleaded guilty.

5. Lam satisfied that the 1st accused pleaded guilty voluntarily,

fully knowing the consequences of pleading guilty. Therefore the plea of

guilt is accepted. The 1st accused is found guilty of the offence
punishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful
Possession) Act, 1966 and hence he is convicted thereunder. Having
regard to the facts and circumstance of the case, I am of the view that this
is not a fit case to invoke the benevolent provisions of the Probation of
Offenders Act.

6. Heard the 1st accused regarding the question of sentence. He
pleaded for leniency. He has no criminal antecedents. ‘The accused had
already undergone custody for a period of 5 days. Even the prosecution
has no case that there was any premeditated intention on the part of the
accused in the commission of the offence. Having regard to the nature
of offence and the value of the property involved and the age of the
accused, I am of the view that imprisonment for not less than one year is
not warranted in this case.

In the result, the ist accused is convicted and sentenced under
section 269(3) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 to
undergo simple imprisonment for 5 days and to pay fine of Rs.2000/-
(two thousand rupees) for the offence punishable under section 3(a) of
the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. In default of
payment of fine the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for 5
days. Set off is allowed under section 297 of the Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 for the period of detention already undergone by
the Ist accused in judicial custody, i.e from 31/10/2023 to 04/11/2023.
‘The case against the 2nd accused is refiled as CC No.535/2024.
