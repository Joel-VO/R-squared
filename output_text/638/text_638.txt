ORDER

Petitioners are accused in C.C. No.81 of 2010 of the
Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, which has
arisen from Crime No.192 of 2009 of the Kasaragod Police
Station, registered for the offences punishable under
Sections 419, 420, 423, 465 and 468 of the Indian Penal
Code read with Section 34 IPC.

2. The matter has been amicably settled between
the petitioners and the defacto complainant, who is the 2"
respondent herein. The defacto complainant has filed
Annexure-A3 affidavit affirming that the matter has been
amicably settled between him and the petitioners and he
has no complaints against the petitioners.

3. No criminal antecedents have been reported

against the petitioners. When the matter has been amicably
 CRLM.C.No. 7842 of 2015,

settled, no purpose would be served in proceeding with the
matter further, and therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.
No.81 of 2010 pending before the Chief Judicial
Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, as against the petitioners,
based on Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime No.192 of
2009 of the Kasaragod Police Station, can be quashed.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings in C.C. No.81 of 2010 pending before the Chief
Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kasaragod, as against the
petitioners, based on Annexure-A2 Final Report in Crime
No.192 of 2009 of the Kasaragod Police Station, are hereby

quashed.
