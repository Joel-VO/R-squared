Crl.M.C.No.4017 of 2015

Dated this the 3” day of January, 2017
ORDER

Essentially, the question is regarding the identity of
the petitioner herein. According to the prosecution, the
second accused could not be apprehended in the course
of investigation and his identity could not be confirmed
through the defacto complainant. On the other hand, the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is
that he has been wrongly implicated on the basis of
mistaken identity and that he has never absconded. The
learned counsel relied on an affidavit filed by the defacto
complainant stating that the present petitioners is not the
person about whom he has raised the allegations. Since
it largely depends on the question of identification of a
person, I am not inclined to consider that in the Crl.M.C.
The petitioners may seek their relief before the trial

court. Reserving that right, the Crl.M.C is closed.
