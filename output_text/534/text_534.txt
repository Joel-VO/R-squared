ORDER

‘These petitions are filed to quash all further proceedings in Crime

No,1602 of 2017 of the Museum Police Station,

2. The specific contention of the petitioners, who are accused
Nos.1 and 3, is that an earlier crime has been registered at the

Kanyakumari Police Station on the very same allegations and in view

of the said fact, the second FIR is not maintainable.

3. A statement has been filed by the Asst. Commissioner of
Police, District Crime Branch, Thiruvananthapuram. In paragraph
No.10, it is stated as follows:

“10. It is learnt that the investigation of
Cr.1/2017/EOW I is in progress successfully by the Crime
Branch wing of Tamilnadu and it is also revealed that the de
facto complainant of Cr.1602/2017 of Museum PS had given
both oral and documentary evidences as witness before the
investigating agency of Tamilnadu State for the same
transactions. Hence action is to be taken to consider and
treat the case in Cr.1602/17 of Museum PS as “Further
Action Dropped” and to that effect a report has to be filed
before the Hon'ble filing court.

4. It is submitted that steps have been taken to submit a report

before the learned Magistrate, where the matters are pending.

In that view of the matter, no separate orders are required

to be issued. These petitions are closed.
