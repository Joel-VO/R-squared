ORDER

Dated this the 7th day of January 2020

Petitioners are accused in Crime No.516/2019 of
Kaipamangalam Police station for having allegedly
committed offences punishable under sections 143, 147,
148, 363, 341, 323, 324, 308 and 506 read with Section
149 Ipc.

2. The only defacto complainant/injured is the
second respondent, who has appeared through counsel and
filed affidavit to the effect that the matter has been
amicably settled with the petitioners and that he has
no grievance against them. A report to that effect has
also been obtained from the investigating officer
through the learned Public Prosecutor. The injuries
sustained are not life threatening. Even while
granting bail to the petitioners, the Sessions Court
was apprehensive of whether an offence under Section
308 IPC would be attracted. No public interest is
involved. The petitioners do not have any criminal
 to0iKERATI

the entire proceedings as against the petitioners
herein in Crime No.516/2019 of Kaipamangalam Police
Station shal] stand quashed under section 482 Cr.Pc and
the petitioners/accused are discharged.
