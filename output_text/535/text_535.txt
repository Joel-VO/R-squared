 Mary Joseph,

CrL.M.C.No. 6165 of 2013. CR

Dated this the 8" day of December, 2017
ORDER

The prayer in this Crl.M.C is to quash Annexure A2 and all
further proceedings initiated pursuant to that. Annexure A2 is
nothing but a final report laid by the Additional Sub Inspector of
Yerroor Police Station against the petitioner herein after concluding
the investigation in Crime No.699/2012, chargesheeting him for the
offences punishable under Section 55(a) and (i) of the Abkari Act (for
short ‘the Act’).

2. The case of the prosecution was as follows:

On 6.9.2012 while conducting patrol duty, the S.1. of Police
and party got a reliable information that a person was transporting
Indian Made Foreign Liquor in a scooter to a place called Manalil in
Ayiranallore Village and when they reached the spot, a four wheeler
scooter was found proceeding to the place and the same was
intercepted. The vehicle was stopped by its rider. On verification of

the scooter, three bottles each of capacity 5ooml. containing Indian
 awi7mmeR9769
CAM.C6165 of 2013,
a

Made Foreign Liquor was found kept therein in a plastic cover.
On questioning, the officials were told by the person that the
liquor was purchased by him from the outlet of Beverages
Corporation at Yerroor and transported for sale in retail. The
liquor along with the scooter were seized. ‘The whereabouts of
the person were collected and he was arrested. ‘The accused
along with the articles were taken to the Police Station and Crime
No.699/2012 was registered for the offences punishable under
Section 55(a) and 55(i) of the Act, true copy of which is appended
to this petition as Annexure Al.

3. Based on the FIR, the investigation was conducted.
‘The same was concluded and on 1.11.2012, a final report was laid
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Punalur, the
true copy of which is appended to this petition as Annexure A2.
The final report was taken on file by the Additional Court of

Sessions, Kottarakkara as $.C.No.451/2013. At that juncture, this

Court was approached by the petitioner under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
 awi7mmeR9769
CAM.C6165 of 2013,
30
seeking to quash Annexure A2 and all further proceedings
initiated pursuant to that.
4. SriARajasimhan, the learned counsel has drawn my
attention to Annexure A2 to contend that, the contraband liquor

allegedly transported by the petitioner is IMFL and the quantity

is 1.5 litres. According to him, as per Section 10 of the Act, the

Government is authorised to prescribe, from time to time, the
quantity of liquor or intoxicating drug, which shall be transported
by a person without a permit issued under the provisions of the
‘Act, either generally for the whole State or for any local area.
According to him, $.R.O.No.127/99 published in the Official
Gazette as G.0.(P) 22/99/TD dated 05.02.2009 is such a
notification issued by the Government in exercise of the power
under Section 10 of the Act and it permits a person to transport
or possess IMFL of quantity 3 litres without a permit or licence

being possessed by him. The counsel urged that in the case on

hand, the petitioner was allegedly transporting 1.5 litres of IMFL,
 2017KERIITOO

CALM.C6165 of 2013,
oe

which is less than 3 litres, being the maximum quantity which a
person is authorised to transport without the authority of permit
or licence, the prosecution proceedings initiated against him will
not sustain, According to him, an allegation that the contraband
liquor was transported by the petitioner for sale is also raised in
Annexure A2 without being supported by any materials in that
regard. Advancing arguments of the nature, the learned counsel
canvassed for quashing Annexure A2 and all further proceedings
initiated pursuant to that.

5. Section 10 of the Act being relevant in the context on
hand is extracted hereunder:~

“10. Transporting of liquor or intoxicating
drug.- No liquor or intoxicating drug, exceeding
such quantity as the Government may, from time
to time, prescribe by notification in the Gazette
either generally for the whole State or for any
local area, shall be transported except under a
permit issued under the provisions of the next
following section.”

Section 10 authorises the Government to issue

Notification in the Official Gazette either generally for the whole
 2017KERIITOO

CALM.C6165 of 2013,
$e

State or for any local area speci

ig the limit of liquor or
intoxicating drug which a person could transport without a
permit in that regard.

7. The Government as per G.O(P)No.29/98/TD dated
5.3.1998 published as S.R.O.No.228/98 in the Kerala Gazette
Extraordinary has enhanced the quantity of the Indian Made
Foreign Liquor that can be possessed and transported without
permit to 45 litres. In view of the large scale misuse of this
facility, the Government has decided to reduce the quantity of
Indian Made Foreign Liquor other than beer, wine and foreign
made foreign liquor that can be possessed and transported
without permit to 1.5 litres and accordingly, Notification
S.R.O.No.127/99 was issued by the Government in exercise of the
power conferred under Sections 10 and 13 of the Act, which

reads:-

SAIEN PETER,

Secretary to Goverment

‘As per S.R.O.No.127/99, the limit of IMFL permitted by the
Government to be possessed or transported by a person is 1.5
litres. The quantum of 1.5 litres has been substituted with 3 litres

by way of amendment introduced by S.R.O.No.725/2003 with

effect from 2.8.2003. Therefore, the position stands as on date is
that a person is legally entitled to possess or transport 3 litres of
IMFL without holding a licence or permit.

9. The allegation of the prosecution has to be viewed in the
said legal backdrop and the material part of Annexure A2 is
reproduced hereunder:-

“quoled aaclimangs germvaccmearmaB gagiesamos}0

10, As per the allegation, based on a reliable information
that a person is transporting IMFL for sale in a scooter towards
Manalil area without any authority and against the provisions of

the Act that the ASI of Police, Yerroor Police Station along with
 awi7mmeR9769
CAM.C6165 of 2013,

96
his associates proceeded to the spot. According to them, they
found the petitioner there and identified him as the man
described by the informant, intercepted the scooter ridden by
him, conducted examination of the scooter and detected the
contraband. It is further alleged that the petitioner on their query
told them that the contraband liquor was bought from Beverages
Corporation outlet at Yerroor and is being transported for sale.
‘The further allegation was that since the petitioner was found
transporting the liquor without any authority to do so, he was
arrested, the contraband was seized and Crime No.699/2012 was
registered. The said crime was investigated and culminated in the
laying of Annexure A2.

11, The allegations when scrutinised, this Court could see
substance in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel.
Firstly, the allegation as it stands on the day discloses the
contraband as IMFL. Secondly, the quantum allegedly

transported is 1.5 litres. Thirdly, the contraband liquor was
 2017KERIITOO

CALM.C6165 of 2013,
10:

allegedly meant for sale. Fourthly, the contraband was allegedly
transported without any documents of authorisation.

12, Therefore, it is revealed from the allegations that the
petitioner was transporting 1.5 litres of IMFL in his scooter
without authorisation. SRO No.127/99, the Notification issued by
the Government in exercise of the power conferred on it under
Section 10 of the Act, as amended by SRO No.725/03, a
Notification issued later, shows the maximum limit of IMFL, a
person can possess or transport without licence or permit is 3
litres. As per the Notification, permit or licence is not required
for possessing or transporting IMFL upto the quantity of 3 litres.
‘The petitioner in the case on hand was carrying 1. litres of IMFL
which comes within the quantity permitted by the Government to
possess or transport without authority.

33, An allegation was also raised in Annexure A2 by the
prosecution that the IMFL was transported by the petitioner for

sale and on its basis, the offences under Sections 55(a) and 55(i) of
 20171KERIA9769

CALM.C6165 of 2013,
ells

the Act were incorporated therein. Therefore it is relevant to
note, what are the materials available for the prosecution to base
its allegation of sale against the petitioner. Before adverting to
the basis for raising the allegation of sale, it is apposite to extract

Section 55 of the Act hereunder:

“55. For illegal import, eteWhoever in
contravention of this Act or of any rule or order
‘made under this Act

(@) imports, exports, transports, transits or
possesses liquor or any intoxicating drug: or
seen

‘() sells or stores for sale liquor or any intoxicating drug:

shall be punishable

(U) for any offence, other than an offence falling clause (d) or

clause (¢), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to

ten years and with fine which shall not be less than rupees one

lakh, and

2) x04
Explanation: For the purpose of this section and section 644,
“intoxicating drug” means any intoxicating substance other than a
narcotic drug or psyshoctropic substance regulated by the Narcotic Drugs
‘and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (Central Act 61 of 1985) . which
the Central Government by Notification declare 10 be an intoxicating
drug.

14, In the case on hand, the basis firstly for the prosecution
to allege sale is the hear say information that a person is

transporting liquor for sale, which according. to the prosecution,
 2017KERIITOO

CALM.C6165 of 2013,
Ids

is a reliable one. The basis secondly was the information given by
the accused himself while questioning that the liquor was
transported for sale. The basis thirdly was the bona fide belief of
the officer, who seized it. It is pertinent to note that an allegation
of sale is difficult to sustain on the three grounds as projected
above.

15. In order to charge the petitioner with an offence under
Section 55 (a) or (i) of the Act, the prosecution must establish
that he is engaged in importing, exporting, transporting,
transiting, possessing, or selling or storing liquor or intoxicating
drug in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rule or
any order made under the Act. As per the Act, in order to be
engaged in any of the acts aforesaid, valid documents conferring
authority are required. Therefore, the prosecution has also to
establish that the petitioner was engaged in activities of the above
nature without any authority. As per SROs. aforementioned, for

transporting IMFL upto 3 litres, a permi

is not required.
 CALM.C6165 of 2013,
1d:

Therefore, the petitioner cannot be found fault with as per the
provisions of the Act for transporting 1.5 litres of spirit without
any authority. For the very reason, he cannot also be found fault
with under sub-sections (a) and (i) Section 55 of the Act.
Therefore, the allegations against the petitioner as per Annexure
A2 will not sustain and Annexure A2 and further proceedings
initiated pursuant to that are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands allowed. Annexure
Az and alll proceedings initiated by Additional Court of Sessions,

Kottarakkara in $.C. No.451/2013 on its basis, stand quashed

forthwith.
