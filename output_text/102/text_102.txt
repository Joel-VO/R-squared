Dated this the 22™ day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.589/2023 of Palode
Police Station, alleging offences punishable under Sections 3,
25(IBMa) of the Arms Act, 1959, apart from 8(1) and (2) of
the Abkari Act, 1967.

. While granting bail to the petitioners in Crl.M.C.982/2023,
the leamed Sessions Judge imposed certain conditions.
‘Thereafter, petitioners approached this Court in
CrI.M.C.No.4965/2023 seeking modification of the conditions
imposed and by order dated 03.07.2023, this Court modified
the conditions and directed that petitioners obtain permission
from the Jurisdictional Court, if they intent to go abroad.

. However, when petitioners approached the learned Magistrate
seeking permission to travel abroad that petition was

dismissed, pointing out that the Magistrate court lacked
 224KERIG6S

Jurisdiction. Subsequently, petitioners once again approached
this Court through Crl.M.C.No.6057/2023 and by order dated
04.08.2023, it was held that the Magistrate was not justified
in dismissing the application, as the final report had not yet
been laid.

|. Pursuant to the above judgment, petitioners filed
GrLM.P.No.4243/23 seeking permission to travel abroad.
However, by the impugned order dated 08.08.2023,
permission was granted to go abroad only for a period of six
months.

. Sri.A.Rajasimhan, the learned counsel for the petitioners,
contended that the order granting permission to travel abroad
only for six months causes serious prejudice to the petitioner
as they had already been employed abroad even at the time

of registration of the crime. It was submitted that

permission ought to be granted for a minimum period of five
years to reside abroad.

SriNoushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor, on the other

hand, submitted that pursuant to the impugned order,
 224KERIG6S

petitioners have already traveled abroad and that no
prejudice would be caused to them as they can appear and
seek extension of the period stipulated, especially since the
final report is about to be filed before the Court.

7. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the court has
already granted permission to the petitioners to go abroad, as
they have been employed in Qatar for the last 12 years.

Conditions have been imposed that pe

joners should appear
before the court as and when required. Since the said

conditions are suffi

ent for the time being to ensure that the

petitioners will appear before the court, I am of the view

that, taking into reckoning employment of the petitioners in
Qatar, the permission for six months is too meagre and can
cause prejudice. Considering the entire circumstances,
permission for two years would be a reasonable period.

8. In the above circumstances, a period of six months granted
to the petitioners to go abroad shall stand modified to two
‘years from 08.08.2023.

9. It is made clear that all other conditions imposed by the
 224KERIG6S

learned Magistrate shall continue. Any further extension of
time can be sought for, from the jurisdictional court in
accordance with law.

‘The Crl.M.C.is disposed of.
