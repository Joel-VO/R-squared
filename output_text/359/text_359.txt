THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 22UKERII226

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

This Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.c. is
filed to quash all further proceedings in Crime
No.209/2017 of Nilamboor Police Station. The
above case is registered against the petitioner
alleging offences punishable under Sections 324
and 308 read with Section 34 of the IPC.

2. The prosecution case in brief is that on

ulted the

02.05.2017 at 8 p.m., the accused ai
defacto complainant in this case and he sustained
injury.

3. When this case came up for consideration
the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the entire dispute between the petitioner and

the 1% respondent are settled out of court. A

lawyer is also appeared for the 1 respondent.
The learned counsel for the 1" respondent also

submitted that the entire dispute are settled out

of court. Annexure A2 is an affidavit filed by
 22UKERII226

the 1 respondent.

4, The learned Public Prosecutor also
submitted that he has no objection in quashing
the proceedings.

5. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and
having perused the affidavit filed by the 1*
respondent, the contents of which are submitted to
be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the
matter has been amicably settled and that no
public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement arrived at

between the parti

, there is no possibility of
the criminal proceedings ending in conviction. As
such, continuance of the proceedings will amount

to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view

of the legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of
Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State
of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there

is no impediment in granting the relief.
 22UKERII226
Therefore, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all
further proceedings consequent to Crime

No.209/2017 of Nilamboor Police Station are

quashed.
