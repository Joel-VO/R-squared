Crl.M.C.No.157 of 2024

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner seeks for a direction to stay all further proceedings in
C.C.No.34 of 2018 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,
Kollam, for a period of nine months.

2. Petitioner is the first accused in C.C.No.34 of 2018 on the files
of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kollam. On 01.12.2023, charge
was framed under Sections 403, 406, 409, 420, 465, 468 and 471 r/w
Section 34 of the Indian Penal code, 1860. On the said date, summons
was issued to CW1 to give evidence on 10.01.2024 (tomorrow).
Summons have also been issued to CW2 to CW4 to give evidence on
15.01.2024 and CWS to CW9 on 16.01.2024 and CW10 on 22.01.2024.
It Is evident that trial has already been scheduled and summons have
been issued to the witnesses. In such circumstances, interference with
the scheduled trial is not legally permissible.

Hence, I find no merit in this Crl.M.C.and the same is dismissed
