‘The occurrence witnesses CWs2 and 3 did not turn up before the Court,
despite steps have been executed against them and the Prosecution also
filed report to effect that their presence cannot be secured in near future.

examination serve no purpose in the aforesaid circumstances. The

Investigating Officer, PW2 specifically admitted during the cross

examination that he has not inspected the CCTV footages at the alleged
place of occurrence which is a busy traffic junction surrounded by several
shops. Thus, on overall consideration of the evidence that has been brought
on record, it is crystal clear that there is nothing on record as revealed
there from so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the
Accused had driven his car rashly negligently and, in a manner, so as to

‘endanger the life of since deceased causing him to succumb to his

juries.
This Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by
adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the
Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (d) are found in

favour of the Accused.

7. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are
found in favour of the Accused, question of sentencing the Accused does not

arise.
