ORDER

This petition was filed under section 14 of the Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest
‘Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”) for taking possession of the
secured asset which is the scheduled property.

2. The petitioner is Kerala State Co-operative Bank. It is
represented by its authorized officer. The petitioner is the secured creditor
and the respondent is the secured debtor. The respondent created a
security interest by virtue of a security agreement in respect of the
scheduled property ie., the secured asset in favour of the petitioner in
respect of the financial assistance that he availed from the petitioner. The
respondent committed default in repaying the loan. Therefore the account
was classified as Non Performing Asset on 14/06/2020. The petitioner
issued a demand notice dated 12/10/2022 w/s.13(2) of the Act to the
respondent calling upon him to repay the loan amount in full within 60
 days. The respondent accepted the notice. Even after the notice u/s.13(2)
of the Act, he did not pay the loan amount within the statutory period. So,
the petitioner filed this petition for taking possession of the secured asset for
realization of the amount due to the petitioner's bank.

3. The authorized Officer of the petitioner filed affidavit in
compliance of Sec.14 of the Act. The affidavit and the documents
produced by the petitioner show that the respondent created a security
interest in respect of the secured asset in favour of the petitioner at the
time of availing loan from the petitioner and failed to repay the amount
even after the receipt of the statutory notice u/s.13(2) of the Act. Hence I
find that the petitioner is entitled for possession of the secured asset which
is the scheduled property through the proceedings of this court.

In the result, the petition is allowed as follows:-

i, Advocate Renjith Ravi R.R (K/2322/2023) is appointed as the
commissioner to take possession of the scheduled property with due
notice to the respondents and hand it over to the petitioner on proper
