ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in CC No.454/2017 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Thripunithura,
which has arisen from Crime No.1588/2015 of Hill Palace
Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections
120B, 406, 419, 420, 424, 465, 468 and 471 read with
Section 34 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably
settled between the petitioners in Crl.M.C.4248/2017 and
the de facto complainant in mediation and the mediation
settlement agreement entered into between them is
produced. In Crl.M.C.8435/2017, the de facto complainant
has filed Annexure-B affidavit affirming that the matter has
been amicably settled between her and the petitioners and

presently, she has no complaints against the petitioners.
 CrLM.C.424888435/2017

3. When the matter is amicably settled between the
parties, no purpose would be served in proceeding with the
matter further. Matters being so, all further proceedings
against the petitioners in CC No.454/2017 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court, Thripunithura, which has
arisen from Crime No.1588/2015 of Hill Palace Police
Station, can be quashed.

In the result, these Cri.M.Cs. are allowed and all
further proceedings against the petitioners in CC
No.454/2017 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,
Thripunithura, which has arisen from Crime No.1588/2015

of Hill Palace Police Station, are quashed.
