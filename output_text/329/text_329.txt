ANIL K.NARENDRAN, 3

DATED THIS THE 28" DAY OF APRIL, 2015
ORDER
The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1539 of 2014 of
Ernakulam Central Police Station, which is now pending as
C.C.No.30 of 2015 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,
Ernakulam. The offence alleged against the petitioner is punishable
under Sections 468 and 471 of IPC. The grievance of the petitioner
is that, the Magistrate Court has already issued non-bailable
warrant against him and if he surrenders before the Magistrate
Court there is every likelihood of the application not being
considered on the very same day. Therefore, the petitioner seeks a
direction to consider his bail application on the day of surrender
itself.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor.
3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this

Cri.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioner to surrender before

the Magistrate Court within a period of two weeks from today and
 201SKERIITASE

Cri.M.C.No.2603/15 a

the Magistrate Court is further directed to consider his bail
application on the day of surrender itself, strictly in accordance
with law. The non-bailable warrant already issued against the
petitioner shall be kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks.
The Cri.M.C. is disposed of as above.
