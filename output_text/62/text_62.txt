‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 Cel.MC.No.47 OF 2020(E)

2

)RDER
Dated this the 7th day of January 2020

The petitioners were released on bail by the
Sessions Court on condition that they shall
appear before the investigating officer on
every Saturday between 9 a.m and 10 a.m.

2. Subsequently, the petitioners had
approached this Court for quashing of the
proceedings and vide order at Annexure - AS, it
was directed by this Court that the
investigation could continue, But the final
report has to be filed after seeking permission
of this Court.

3. Subsequently, the petitioners had
approached the Sessions Court for modification
of the direction regarding the appearance
before the investigating officer on every
Saturday. The order was modified to the effect

that they shall appear before the investigating
 Cel.MC.No.47 OF 2020(E)

3
officer on every second Saturday. That order at

Annexure A-6 is challenged before this Court.

Considering the facts that the final report
has to be filed only after getting permission
of this Court, I find that the direction to
appear before the investigating officer on
every second Saturday is not very relevant and
necessary. The petitioners shall appear before
the investigating officer as and when called
for. The impugned order is modified to that

effect.

The Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.
