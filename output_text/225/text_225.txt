BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Dated this the 23 day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is the 1* accused in Crime No.991/2023 of
Badiadukka Police Station, Kasargod District. Petitioner's application
for release of his passport was rejected by the learned Magistrate by
order dated 05.01.2024 in Cri.M.P.No.1544/2023 referring to the

condition imposed by this Court in the order dated 08.12.2023.

Ihave heard Sri.P.E.Sajal, learned Counsel for the petitioner
and Sri.K.A.Noushad, learned Public Prosecutor.
3. Pursuant to the registration of Crime No.991/2023 of

Badiadukka Police Station, petitioner was granted an interim bail by

this Court on 08.12.2023. One of the conditions directed was to
surrender his passport before the jurisdictional court while executing
the interim bail bond. However, subsequently on 19.12.2023, when
the final order was issued by this Court, allowing the bail application,

there was no condition for surrendering the passport. Since the

iterim order issued by this Court on 08.12.2023 has merged with the

final order dated 19.12.2023, it can only be the final order that
remains alive.

4. As there is no condition directing deposit of passport in
 2024KERI6O62
GRL.MC NO. 435 OF 2024

3
the final order, petitioner is not required to surrender his passport nor
can the court retained the passport already surrendered.

5. In the above circumstances, there is no necessity for
even a direction to lift or modify the condition regarding the deposit
of the passport. Therefore, further retention of the passport of the
petitioner by the court is not sanctioned by law.

6. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-l to forthwith release the passport deposited
pursuant to the order dated 08.12.2023 in B.A.No.10435/2023 to the
petitioner.

The Crl.M.C. is allowed.
