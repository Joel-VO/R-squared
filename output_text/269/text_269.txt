Dated this the 1* day of January, 2014
ORDER

Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Public
Prosecutor and the learned counsel appearing for the additional second
respondent.

2. Petitioner has been implicated as accused in Crime
No825/2011 registered by Karunagappally Police Station alleging
commission of offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 463 and
468 of Indian Penal Code. Petitioner herein seeks to quash the
proceedings pursuant to the above crime on the ground that the
allegations in the complaint will not constitute the offences as alleged.

3. Learned Public Prosecutor submits that the investigation is
going on and the investigation conducted so far reveals that the

peti

ner has committed the offence of cheating by making forged
documents.

4. In that view of the matter, I am not inclined to express any
opinion on the merits of the case. If the petitioner appears before the

learned Magistrate within two months from today and applies for bail,

Magistrate deems fit. The petitioner shall co-operate with the
investigation and shall not try to tamper with the evidence.

CrLM.. is disposed of as above.
