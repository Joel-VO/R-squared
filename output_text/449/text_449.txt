 Dated 3% August, 2016

LA tipper lorry bearing registration No.KL 22-C 813 was
seized by the 1* respondent herein on the allegation that
the said vehicle was used for transporting red earth,

2.A crime was registered as Crime No.302 of 2016 of
Pothencode Police Station under Sections 4(1) read with
Section 21 (1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development
and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as
MMDR Act, 1957 and under Sections 420, 294(b), and 353
read with Section 34 of the IPC.

3.The petitioner had filed an application for getting the
interim custody of the vehicle and the said application was
allowed as per Annexure A order subject to various
conditions. The petitioner is aggrieved by condition No.
(b), (c) and (h) of Annexure A1 order.

4.Heard the rival submissions.

Cri.M.C, No.4936 of 2016 om

5.lt is submitted by the learned counsel that the learned
Magistrate relied on the judgment of this Court in Shan_v.
State_of Kerala (2010 (3) KLT 413 [FB]) while
imposing the onerous conditions. The learned counsel
urges that the said judgment was rendered while dealing
with vehicles seized under the provisions of the Kerala
Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of
Sand Act, 2001. The learned counsel also relies on the
judgment of this Court in Sasiv. State of Kerala (2013
(4) KLT 731) to contend that this Court has taken a view
that the dictum of law laid down in Shan (supra) cannot
be made applicable while considering the applications
seeking interim custody of the vehicles seized invoking the
provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957. Finally the learned
counsel submits that the provisions of MMDR Act as well
as the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining,

Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter
 2016KERII804

Cri.M.C, No.4936 of 2016 3.

referred to as “the Transportation Rules, 2015") were
challenged before this Court and referring to the interim
orders dated 1.9.2015 in W.A.1889 and 1890 of 2015 and
also the order dated 14.6.2016 in W.A.1126 and 1129 of
2016, contends that the vehicles were ordered to be
released subject to conditions and those conditions be
imposed in the instant case as well.

6.Having regard to the facts and circumstances and taking
note of the conditions imposed in the Writ Appeals, I am
of the view that the condition imposed by the learned
Magistrate can be suitably modified. In substitution of
condition Nos. (b), (c) and (h), the learned Magistrate is
directed to release the afore said vehicle on deposit of an
amount of Rs.25,000/- and on condition that the
petitioner executes a bond for Rs.25,000/- with two
solvent sureties. The learned Magistrate is directed to

impose appropriate conditions to _ prevent
 2016KERII804

Cri.M.C, No.4936 of 2016 4

alienation/transfer of the vehicle and subsequent
production of the vehicle.

7.However, the conditions imposed as aforesaid will be
subject to modification later, in terms of the final orders in
the Writ Appeals, referred to in para 4 above. The 1*
respondent will be at liberty to seek for modification
without referring the matters to this Court and in that
event the learned Magistrate is directed to pass
appropriate orders in accordance with law.

The petition is disposed off as above.
