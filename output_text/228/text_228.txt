ORDER

Petitioner challenges the proceedings in C.C.No.126/2022 on the
files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kalpetta. According to the
petitioner, the allegations in the final report does not make out any
offence against the petitioner as he is the Managing Director of a
‘company, which is a franchisee of a company empaneled by the
Government of India and no criminal proceedings can be initiated
against him on the basis of the final report.

2. The prosecution alleges that the accused had collected
money from the defacto complainant after offering to provide a software
to the ‘Suvidha Kendra’ for filing GST retums and thereafter failed to
provide the software and thus committed the offences under Section
403, 406, 420 r/w Section 1208 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

3. Though Sri.P.M.Ziraj, learned Counsel for the petitioner
vehementaly contended that the offences alleged against the petitioner
are not all made out, this Court notices that the case is scheduled for
trial on 18.01.2024, ie. tomorrow. The attempt of the accused to quash
the proceedings on the eve of the trial cannot be encouraged. Since all

these years petitioner had not chosen to challenge the proceedings and

the trial has already been scheduled to take place tomorrow, this Court
is not inclined to consider exercising the inherent jurisdiction under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings. The petitioner will
have an effective remedy by participating in the trial and no prejudice
will be caused since the trial will be completed in a short time as well
Therefore, without considering any of the contentions on merits
and leaving it open for consideration by the Trial Court, this Crl.M.C. is

dismissed.
