THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
08.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 ORDER
Dated this the 8th day of January 2020

The petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order of
the learned Sessions Judge at Annexure A2, where the
bail granted to the petitioner in crime No. 265/2019 of
Kodakkara Police Station was cancelled for the reason
that he failed to comply with condition no.4 which
insisted that he shall not get involved in any other
crime during the pendancy of the bail. The bail was
granted on 09/07/2019, but soon thereafter on
13/07/2019, he got involved in another crime as crime
No. 322/2019 of Kodakkara Police Station and consequent
to that, the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail
granted to him by way of impugned order. The petitioner
is aggrieved and is before this Court.

2. The learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner submits that as per Annexure Al, the defacto
complainant in Crime No. 322/2019 has filed an affidavit
stating that the petitioner was not involved. The FIR
also does not show his name. It gives the name of two
persons and other five are unidentified. The learned

Sessions Judge had considered the said affidavit and has
 CeL.MC.No. 8368 OF 2019(E)
3

stated that for the purpose of granting of bail, the
petitioner and accused Ratheesh had approached the
defacto complainant and requested his father to say
before the Court that the petitioner was not involved
among the other accused. His father is a sick person and
out of fear of the accused, his father went to the
office of the lawyer of the accused and instructed
filing an affidavit. Only in order to keep the word of
his father, the defacto complainant reached the Court
and informed that the petitioner, Sreekuttan was not
involved in that crime. It is apparent that it is out of
fear and coercion that he had made such a statement in
the affidavit filed before the Court.

The learned Sessions Judge on understanding thes
circumstances cancelled the bail granted to the
petitioner. I find no reason whatsoever to interfere in

this finding and therefore, the criminal MC is

dismissed.
