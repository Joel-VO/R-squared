P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.160 of 2015

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2015
ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C.
No.315/2014 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur.
2. On the apprehension of arrest and remand to

judicial custody on surrender, the petitioner seeks a direction
from this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, to the court below to release him on bail, on
appropriate conditions. The offences involved are under
Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.

3. The learned counsel submits that the petitioner
has already settled all the claims with some other persons and
earnest efforts are now being made to settle the whole dispute.
It is also submitted that the transaction alleged in the final
report is in fact a civil transaction having only civil
consequences. Anyway, these aspects will have to be looked into
by the learned Magistrate when the application for bail is
considered. The learned Magistrate who has issued warrant of

arrest for proper and legal reasons will have to consider the
 201SKERIII62

AAMC No, 160 2018 2
petitioner's request and pass appropriate orders. I do not think
that the learned Magistrate will mechanically remand him to
judicial custody without hearing his grievance and without
understanding the facts of the case, However, a direction can be
given to the court below to dispose of the application without
delay.

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
closed with direction to the court below that if application for
bail is filed by the petitioner on surrender in C.C No.315/2014, it
shall be judiciously considered, and appropriate orders shall be
passed, on the date of surrender itself, however with notice to

the other side.
