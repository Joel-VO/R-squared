Cri, M. C. No. 6368 of 2016

Dated this the 3” day of October, 2016
ORDER

The petitioners are the accused in Crime No.296/2014 of

Kudiyanmala Police Station, Kannur District for offences punisable
under Sections 452, 341, 323, 294(b), 354 read with 34 IPC.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on
10.07.2014 at 8.30 p.m., the petitioners trespassed into the
house of the defacto complainant and pulled her towards the

varanda. When CW2 tried to obstruct the petitioners, the accused

hit them and the 1* petitioner caught hold of her hand thereby

affecting her modesty. Other accused have also committed

various specific overt acts. On the basis of the complaint lodged,
crime was registered. After investigation final report was laid.
Cognizance was taken and the matter is now pending as
C.C.No.1344/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Taliparamba.

3. The petitioners have now approached this Court stating
that, the disputes between the parties have been voluntarily and
amicably settled. The defacto complainant is stated to have no

further grievance as against the petitioners. A joint petition has
 2016KERIA2229
Cri. M, C. No, 6368 of 2016

been filed by the petitioners and the respondents 2 to 4 jointly
stating that, the parties have settled their disputes. Separate
affidavits have also been filed by the respondents 3 and 4,
wherein they have reiterated the settlement arrived at and also
‘expressed their mind that they do not propose to pursue the
matter.

4, Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted
that the petitioners herein are not involved in any other crime and
the information is that, the parties have resolved their disputes.

5. Having regard to these, | am satisfied that the dispute
is essentially a private one and does not involve any larger public
interest. In the light of the settlement, interest of justice
demands that further continuation of the proceedings should be
given a premature end to. Hence, | am inclined to allow the
prayer sought for.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in
C.C.No.1344/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Taliparamba stand quashed.
