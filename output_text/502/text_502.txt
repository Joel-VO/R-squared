THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 22UKERINIDS

V.G.ARUN, J.

Dated this the 7® day of January, 2021

ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.394 of 2011
registered at the Chittarikkal Police Station for the offence
punishable under Sections 420 and 1208 r/w 34 of IPC and
Sections 3, 4 5 and 6 of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation
Schemes (Banning) Act 1978, now pending as C.C.No.450 of
2018 of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod. The de facto
complainant and the witnesses at whose instance the crime was
registered are respondents 3 to 8. Annexures A3, A4, AS, A6,
‘A7 and A8 affidavits have been filed by respondents 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8 respectively stating that the dispute has been settled and
that they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on
instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal
antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,
nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed

by the respondents 3 to 8, the contents of which are submitted
 22UKERINIDS

to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is
settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter.
Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal
proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such,
continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out
by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.
State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State
of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no
impediment in granting the relief sought.

4. In the result, this Cri.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in
C.C.No.450 of 2018 of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod, as far
{as petitioners are concerned, is quashed.
