Cri.M.C, No. 6043 OF 2013

Dated this the 2 day of January, 2014
ORDER

The petitioner is the 1* accused in Crime No.1927/2009 of
Ernakulam Town North Police Station, Ernakulam. The offences
alleged are punishable under Sections 3,4,5 & 7 of Immoral Traffic
Prevention Act. The police, after investigation, laid the charge
sheet before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court (EO),
Ernakulam and is numbered as C.C.No.38/2010.

3. The respondent Circle Inspector of Police conducted the
search and arrested the accused. As per provisions under Section

13 of the Act, he is not an officer competent to conduct search

because, the detecting officer is neither a Traffic Police Officer nor
a Special Officer, who has the authority to search and conduct
arrest as per the provisions of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act.

4. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the search and
arrest were not effected in accordance with the provisions of the
‘Act. There is no possibility of the case to end in conviction.

5. In view of the admitted position in this case, that the

search was not effected by the Special Police Officer and the

arrest was also not in accordance with law, same has to be held
per se illegal. This is a fit case wherein, this Court should invoke
the inherent power vested under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to
terminate the procedure.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
in C.C.No.38/2010 pending before the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court (EO), Ernakulam is quashed
