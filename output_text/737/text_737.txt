ORDER

The peti

ner herein is arrayed as the second
accused in Crime No.1020 of 2016 of Chingavanam Police
Station for offences punishable under sections 342, 323,
324 and 302 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code. After investigation, final report was laid and the
matter is pending as CP.No.50.2017 before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-I, Changanasserry. The case
stood posted to 23.11.2017 for the appearance of the
accused. It is stated that on that day, the petitioner
appeared through counsel and filed vakkalath along with
an application to excuse the absence of accused. The
reason stated was that he was suffering from illness. The
case was adjourned to 14.12.2017 on which day also the
petitioner herein was absent. The reason stated was that
the petitioner had not recovered from the illness. The
court below rejected the application for excusing the

absence of the accused and issued non bailable warrant.

2. The petitioner has approached this court
contending that he was appearing before the court below
through the counsel and was effectively represented by
the counsel. However, the petitioner submits that he is
ready and willing to appear before the court below and to
submit himself to its jurisdiction and also to appear on all
future posting dates personally or through the counsel.
The only anxiety of the petitioner herein is that since non
bailable warrant has been issued, he is likely to be
remanded.

3. Having considered the fact that the petitioner
herein was effectively represented through the counsel on
both the occasion, I am inclined to permit the petitioner
herein to surrender before the court below within a period
of ten days from today. If he so appears and files
application for recalling the warrant, the application shall
be taken up by the court below on the same day itself and
shall pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. The

warrant issued by the court below will be kept in
