P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.7219 of 2014

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2015

ORDER

A prosecution under Sections 341, 324 and 307
r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code is sought to be quashed under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground of
amicable settlement made by the parties out of court on the
intervention of persons acceptable to both sides. The 2"
respondent herein is the first informant on whose complaint the
crime was registered by the police, and the first respondent is
his son, who sustained injuries in the alleged incident of assault.
‘The petitioners are the three accused in the said crime, which is
now pending as C.P No.69/2013 before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Nilambur. The respondents 1 and 2 have filed
affidavit to the effect that the whole dispute stands settled
amicably, and that they have no grievance or complaint now. It
is in fact really doubtful whether the allegations in the case will
come under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code as a case of

attempted murder. Of course it is true that the first respondent
 201SKERIII77

CeLM.C No.7219 of 2014 2
had sustained fracture of his frontal bone in the alleged incident
of assault. That by itself, will not attract the offence under
Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. For such a prosecution on
the allegation of attempted murder something strong and
definite is required, but such strong materials are not there.
Anyway, the dispute now stands amicably settled, and the parties
have come to terms. It is submitted that the parties are now on
quite cordial terms, and the whole dispute between them which
gave rise to the alleged incident of assault, stands resolved
forever.

2. In so many decisions the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable
offences like 307 IPC, the High Court can quash the prosecution;
be it at the crime stage, or at the trial stage, or even at the
appellate or revisional stage, if the parties have really settled the
whole dispute, and continuance of prosecution will not serve any
purpose, or will otherwise cause harm and hardship to parties.
Here I find a case of true and genuine settlement between the
parties, and now they are on quite cordial terms. In such a
situation, continuance of the prosecution will not serve any

purpose, and it may even cause harm and embarrassment to
 201SKERIII77

CeLM.C No.7219 of 2014 3
both the parties. In such a situation, the prosecution can be
quashed.

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C
No.892/2012 of the Nilambur Police Station, now pending as
committal proceeding in C.P No.69/2013 before the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Nilambur, will stand quashed under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the
petitioners will stand released from prosecution, and the bail

bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged.
