Crl.M.C.No.9101 of 2016

Dated this the 27 day of December, 2016
ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.2734 of 2016 on the file
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -II, Nedumangad.
‘The major offence alleged is under Section 380 of IPC. She was
granted bail as per order in C.M.P.No.16099 of 2016 of the said
court. While granting bail, the petitioner was directed to
execute a bond for $50,000/- along with two solvent sureties. It
is directed that at least one among the sureties shall be a close
blood relative of the accused, for which she shall produce proof.
‘The grievance is against the said imposition of condition. After
hearing the learned Public Prosecutor and also considering the
submission, the second condition imposed by the learned
Magistrate is modified as follows:

‘One among the sureties shall be a close blood relative of
the accused and if one of the sureties is a close blood relative,

she need not be a person having properties. If such a surety is

not available, the petitioner is at liberty to produce solvent
sureties and the solvency can be verified by the court below by

appropriate directions.
