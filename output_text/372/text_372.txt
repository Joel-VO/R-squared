ORDER

The petitioner in two Crl.M.Cs. viz., accused
No.1 and accused No.3, 8, 4 and 6 came up to quash
Annexure A9 complaint and Annexure Al0 order taking
cognizance for the offence under Section 420 r/w
Section 34 IPC. What is alleged is based on the
breach of contract and obligation arising out of
it. It was contended that the defacto complainant
agreed to supply rock boulders for the project of
Vizhinjam International Sea Port and a letter of
intent for supply of 84,00,000 MTS of rock boulders
within 24 months was placed with the defacto
complainant. It is alleged that defacto complainant
accordingly arranged rock boulders to a
considerable extent. They have also received part
payment of Rs.2,75,00,000/- and Rs.1,85,00,000/-,
totalling Rs.4,60,00,000/-. But subsequently, the
contract was assigned to somebody else causing big
loss to the complainant. The very nature of the
complaint would prima facie show what is involved

is a civil liability arising out of a concluded
 cel.mc, 3800/2020 & 02UKERISI

cei .mc. 3806/2020

contract and its breach. The facts narrated and
alleged would not constitute any delivery of
Property or detention of property either
fraudulently or dishonestly under any deception or
cause any damage by that means to the property or
reputation of any person so as to attract the
ingredient which would constitute ‘cheating’ as
defined under Section 415 IPC. Hence it would be a
futile exercise if it is proceeded further. The
complaint and the order taking cognizance against
the petitioners are hereby quashed.

Crl.M.Cs. are allowed accordingly.
