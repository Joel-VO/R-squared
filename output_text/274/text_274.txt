‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 1627 of 2016

Dated this the 4 day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner seeks to quash all further proceedings arising
from Annexure 1, now pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court - 1, Thrissur as C.C.No.320/2013. It seems that,
there were several disputes between the petitioner herein and the
1 respondent. One of the case was disposed of by this Court by
Annexure A3 judgment, pursuant to the settlement arrived at in a
mediation.

2. When the matter was taken up, learned counsel for the
petitioner submitted that, all amounts payable by the petitioner
herein has been directly paid through the trial court. Since the 1*
respondent was appearing through Mr.Santhosh Poduval in the
other connected cases, notice on R1 was served on Mr.Santhosh
Poduval, who appeared and submitted that, the entire amounts
due have been received. Respondents 3 to 8 are represented by
another counsel.

3. Having heard all the counsel, | am satisfied that the

disputes have been settled to the satisfaction to the parties. In
 2016KERI4106
Cri. M, C. No, 1627 of 2016

the light of the above, all further proceedings in C.C.No.320/2013
pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - 1,
Thrissur stand quashed.

Crl.M.C, stands disposed of accordingly.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
