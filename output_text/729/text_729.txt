THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION oN
09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING
 Cel.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 2 20197KERII

ORDER

Petitioner was the first accused in
C.C.No.84 of 2006 n the file of the Chief
Judicial Magistrate Court, Kottayam. He along
with the second accused was charged with having
committed the offences under Section 420 IPC.
On his failure to appear in the court
proceedings under Sections 82 and 83 were
initiated. Still he did not appear. His case
was removed to the register of long pending
cases, the number being L.P.No.7/2011. The co-
accused was tried and acquitted. It is stated
that the order removing the case of the
petitioner to the register of long pending cases
was illegal. It is further submitted that the
matter has been settled between the petitioner
and the second respondent who is the victim.

The proceedings are sought to be quashed.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the
 Cel.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 3 20197KERII

petitioner and the second respondent and the

learned Public Prosecutor.

3. The proceedings against the petitioner
under Sections 82 and 83 were simultaneously
involved by the trial court. This court in
“Molly Vs. State [1994(1)KLJ 930]” held that
such a procedure is illegal. So the order of
transferring the case to the register of long

pending cases was illegal.

4, I have perused the Annexure A2 Judgment
by which the co-accused was acquitted. The
Second respondent has entered appearance through
counsel. I am satisfied that the matter has
been settled. The proceedings against the

petitioner are liable to be quashed.

In the result this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The
order by which the case of the petitioner was
removed to the register of long pending cases is

set aside. The proceedings against the
 CrL.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 4 2019KERI2

petitioner in C.C.No.33 of 2010, which was

refiled from C.C.No.84 of 2006 are quashed.
