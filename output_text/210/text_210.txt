Cri.M.C.No.311 of 2024

Dated this the 12 day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in C.P.No.27 of 2023 before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court, Ambalappuzha, arising out of Crime No.105
of 2022 of Punnapra Police Station. The offences alleged against the
petitioner include Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under
the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.

2. According to Smt.Anakha Babu, the learned counsel for the
petitioner, though bail was taken by the petitioner at the crime stage,
subsequently he had not received summons from the Magistrate's Court
and therefore he was unaware about the pendency of the proceedings.
Without serving summons on the petitioner, non-bailable warrant has
been issued for his failure to appear before the Magistrate's court. It was
submitted that the petitioner went abroad immediately after taking bail
and therefore there is no possibility of having served summons on him.

3. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as
well.

4, Having regard to the circumstances of the case especially since
the petitioner alleges that he had never been served with summons and
taking note of the proposed wedding of the petitioner on 28.01.2024,

Lam of the view that a direction can be issued to consider the application

for recall of warrant and for grant of bail on the same day itself.

In view of the above, there will be a direction to the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court, Ambalappuzha to consider the application for
bail and the application for recall of warrant, if any filed by the petitioner
in C.P.No.27 of 2023, on the same day itself provided the petitioner files
such applications on or before 22.01.2024.

‘The Cri.M.C.is disposed of as above.
