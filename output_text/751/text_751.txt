ORDER
Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.702 of 2014 of the

arisen from Crime No.764 of 2013 of the Pattanakadu Police
Station, registered for the offences punishable under Sections
447 and 427 IPC read with Section 34 IPC.

2. It'seems that the matter has been amicably settled
between the parties.

3. On going through the facts and circumstances of
the case, it seems that the matter can be permitted to be
settled. It has been reported that no criminal antecedents
have been reported against the petitioner. The defacto
complainant has filed Annexure-A¢ affidavit affirming that the
matter has been amicably settled between him and the
petitioner and he has no complaints against the petitioner.
Considering the fact that the matter has already been settled

amicably between the parties, this court is satisfied that no
 (CrLM.C.No.8412 of 2017 2

purpose would be served in proceeding with the trial of the
case. Matters being so, Annexure-A1 First Information Report,
Annexure-A2 Final Report and all further proceedings in
C.C.No.702 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court-I, Cherthala, which has arisen from Crime No.764 of
2013 of the Pattanakadu Police Station, as against the
petitioner, are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Cr.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-A1

further proceedings in C.C.No.702 of 2014 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-!, Cherthala, which has arisen from
Crime No.764 of 2013 of the Pattanakadu Police Station, as
