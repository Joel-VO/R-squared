Crl.M.C.No.8595 of 2017

Dated this the 3” day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioners herein stand arrayed as the accused
in Crime No. 528/2016 of the Irinjalakuda Police Station
now pending as CP.No.CP.No.69/2016 of Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-I, Irinjalakuda for offences
punishable under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The prosecution allegation is that on 11.3.2016
at 12.13 noon, the petitioners herein trespassed into the
shop run by the third respondent, and standing in the
name of his wife, by showing a weapon threatened the
second respondent, who was the employee, and had
stolen three mobile phones and Rs.20,000/- kept in the
drawer. Pursuant to the crime registered, investigation
was conducted and final report was laid. The matter is
now pending before the court.

3. The petitioners contending that the dispute was
a purely personal dispute between the parties and though

it has been given a serious colour to make it a grave
 Crl.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2018KERAS

2

offence, the matter has now been settled between the
parties, has approached this court. It was contended by
the learned counsel for the petitioners that the disputes
were settled between the parties evidenced by Annexure-
A3 and 4 affidavits, affirmed by the second and third
respondents, The learned counsel for the second and
third respondents acknowledged the due execution of the
above affidavits in acceptance of the settlement between
the parties. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted
that the disputes have been resolved and that the
petitioners herein have no criminal antecedents. It was
submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that
even though there was an allegation that they had
committed dacoity by show of force, the investigation did
not reveal any serious offence. It was pointed out by the
learned counsel for the petitioners that though there was
an allegation that a weapon was used to threaten the
defacto complainant, in fact the weapon was not
recovered. Hence the ingredients of the offence to that

extent will not lie, It was further contended by the
 Crl.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2018KERAS

3
learned counsel that the amount allegedly taken from the
drawer had also not been recovered. Hence there is no
material to substantiate that part of the allegation.
Hence it was contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioners that at the most the allegation may confine to
stealing of two mobile phones. It was submitted by the
learned counsel that it was only a dispute between the
parties relating to the purchase of mobile phones.
Considering the above facts and also the fact that the
petitioners are not involved in any other case and in the
light of the settlement reported by the parties, I feel that
no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners
herein, Accordingly, a quietus is liable to be given to the
entire prosecution.

5, Hence the Crl.M.C is allowed quashing all
further proceedings in CP.NO.69/2016 on the files of the
Judicial First Class magistrate Court-I, Irinjalakuda arising
from Crime No.528/2016 of Irinjalakuda Police Station.
