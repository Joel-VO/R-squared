ORDER

[ Crl.Mc 7608/2018 ,Crl.MC.7703/2018 }

Crl.M.C.No.7608/2018 arises from Crime No. 58 of 2012 of
Peringome Police station, for offences punishable under sections
143,147,148,341,323,324,506(ii), 354 read with section 149 IPC.
Allegation of the prosecution is that, petitioners herein attacked the
defacto complainants on 20/1/2012 at 11.45 a.m. It was alleged that,
it was pursuant to a protest against running of a quarry. Respondents
1 to 3 are the defacto complainants. Now the matter is pending as CC
No, 475/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Payyannur.

2. CrLM.C. No.7703/2018 arises from Crime No.57/2012 of
Peringom police station for offences punishable under sections
341,323,324,294(b), 506(ii), read with section 341PC. Allegation of the
prosecution is that petitioners herein attacked the defacto
complainant on 20/1/2012 at 11.45 a.m. Matter is now pending as
C.C.No,229/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Payyannur,

3, Accused in both the cases have approached this court to
quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at
between the parties. To substantiate their statement, parties relied

on the affidavit submitted by the defacto complainants.
 ‘CALM.C. No.7608 & 7703/2018, 6 20191KERI6I4

4, It is seen that accused 1 and 2 in Crime No. 57/2012 are the
defacto complainants in Crime No. 58/2012. Learned counsel on
instructions submitted that parties have settled their disputes in both

the cases and their statements have been recorded.

5.Considering the fact that, the petitioners have no criminal
antecedents and the settlement arrived at between the parties is on
record, I am inclined to quash the proceedings.

Accordingly, Crl.M.Cs are allowed. All further proceedings
pending as CC No. 475/2013 and 29/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate

of First Class, Payyanur stand quashed.
