of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to her under section 207
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. After hearing prosecution and counsel for
accused charge framed for offences w/s. 294(b) and 324 of Indian Penal Code,
1860, read over and explained to the accused to which she pleaded not guilty

and claimed to be tried.

5. On the side of prosecution, PW1 was examined and Ext. P1 was marked. As
the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the learned
Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CW2 to CWS. In the absence of any
incriminating circumstances against the accused questioning of the accused
under section 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was dispensed with.
Accused was called upon to adduce evidence but no defence evidence was

adduced from the side of the accused.

6. Heard both sides and perued records.

7. The following points have arisen for determination:
(1) Whether on the same day and same time the accused uttered the obscene
word against PWI and thereby committed the offence ws.294(b) of the

Indian Penal Code, 1860 ?
 405

@) Whether on the same day, at same time and place accused threw a granite
piece towards PW1 and thereby accused committed an offence punishable
ws. 324 of Indian Penal Code, 1860?

8) If the accused is found guilty? What is the order as to sentence?

8. Point Nos. 1 and 2 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point numbers 1 and
2 are considered together. Prosecution case is that accused has committed

offences punishable under sections 294(b) and 324 of Indian Penal Code, 1860.

9. PWI Rani admitted her signature in Ext. P1. She deposed that the accused has

not assaulted her and she has no grievance against the accused.

10. The leamed Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and she
is justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of
prosecution. Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view
that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused. For the said reason

these points are found against the prosecution.

11, Point No. 3 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, the accused is found not
guilty of offences punishable under sections 294(b) and 324 of Indian Penal
Code, 1860 and she is acquitted for the said offences under section 248(1)
