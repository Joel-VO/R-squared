THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON

08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 (cet.Me.to, 4434 oF 2020(0) 2 2021/KER/I280

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

This petition is filed to issue appropriate direction to the
lower court to take steps to execute Annexure A8 order.

When this matter came up for consideration today, it is seen
reported by the lower court that, Annexure A8 order is already
set aside in Crl.A No.163/2019 by the II Additional Sessions
Judge, Kollam. In the light of the above judgment, I think this
Criminal Miscellaneous Case need not be kept pending.

Therefore, this Cri.M.C is closed.
