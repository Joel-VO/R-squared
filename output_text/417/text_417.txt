CrI.M.C.No.4619 of 2017

the 8° day of January, 2018

ORDER

The sole accused in SC No.1518/2015 of the District and
Sessions Court, Kollam arising from Crime No.458/2009 of
Ezhukone Police station is the petitioner herein.

2, The above case arose from a private complaint dated
27/7/2009 filed by the third respondent herein. It was alleged in
the private complaint that, the petitioner herein was in love with
the defacto complainant, who is the third respondent herein, from
2003 onwards, and on 16/7/2008 and 20/7/2008, he committed
rape on the third respondent and thereafter on several occasions,
on a specific assurance to marry her. She became pregnant and
delivered a child. Prior to that, she along with her family members
had attempted to settle the matter. In pursuance to it, the third
respondent gave notice of special marriage under the Special
Marriage Act. While so, the petitioner allegedly retracted from it.
The third respondent gave birth to a female child on 15/3/2009. It

was alleged that, the child was born on account of the physical
 2018KERI704
CHLM.C.No 46192017 2

relationship of petitioner with the third respondent, Even though
complaint was laid to the police, they did not take any action, and
hence, the private complaint was filed. A copy of the private
complaint was produced as Annexure A1. The above complaint was
referred to the police by the Magistrate, invoking section 156(3) of

cri

and crime was registered. After investigation, Annexure A
final report was filed.

3. The petitioner herein, contending that it is an absolutely
false case and that he is sought to be falsely implicated, has sought
to quash the entire proceedings. The father of the petitioner herein
had purchased an item of property from the family of the third
respondent and a house was constructed therein. It was contended
that, the petitioner herein was the neighbour of the third
respondent, who was leading a loose life. Subsequently, disputes
relating to the property arose and 0.S.No.205/2009 was filed by
the father of the petitioner against the third respondent and her
family members. Annexure AS is the copy of the above plaint dated
26/5/2009. It was alleged in the plaint itself that the third
respondent herein was leading a loose life .

4, In spite of service of notice of the Cri.M.C.on the third
respondent, she had not chosen to contest the proceedings. Heard
the learned counsel for the petitioner, leamed Public Prosecutor
and perused the records.

5. It was strenuously contended by the learned counsel for
 2018KERI704
CHLM.C.No 46192017 3

the petitioner that, the entire facts disclosed that it was an
absolutely false case, without any bona fides. It was contended
that the complaint was highly belated. Even though it was alleged
that, the petitioner committed rape of the third respondent in the
year 2008 and that she delivered a baby on 15/3/2009, the
complaint was laid only on 27/7/2009. This delay has not been
explained. It was also alleged by her that, even when she was
seven months’ pregnant, she had suspicion that, the petitioner
herein was trying to avoid her and to retract from the promise for
marriage. Hence,it was disclosed to her mother and attempts
were allegedly made to enter into a matrimonial relationship, by
registering the marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Even
though this attempt failed, the complaint was filed much later and
the delay has not been explained by the third respondent cogently.
6. Of course, the third respondent has a case that though an
application for registering the marriage under the Special
Marriage Act was filed and notice given, it did not materialse. The
petitioner herein has an explanation in Annexure AS that, he was
trapped into by signing such document at the instance of others,
without knowing that the notice given was for an intended
marriage with the third respondent herein. According to the
petitioner herein, he never intended to marry the third respondent.
7. The specific allegation in the complaint was that, the

petitioner herein committed rape of the third respondent on
 2018KERI704
CHLM.C.No 46192017 4

specified dates and consequently, the child was born in the
physical relationship with the third respondent. The petitioner had
denied the paternity. In the course of the investigation, samples
were drawn from the petitioner , child and the third respondent
herein and sent for conducting DNA test. Annexure A3 is the
report dated 15/2/2010 of the DNA test. By the above report, the
petitioner herein was excluded from the paternity of the child.
Records also reveal that, thereafter the third respondent herein
gave statement that she had physical relationship with one Shiju
Yohanan and the child was born out of that relationship.
Accordingly, investigating agency conducted DNA test of Shiju
Yohanan and the child, Annexure A4 is the report dated
15/10/2010 of the DNA test. That report indicates that, Shiju
Yohanan also was excluded from the paternity of the child. The
records also indicate that, thereafter, further statement of the
third respondent was recorded in which she stated that she had
physical relationship with the petitioner and Shiju Yohannan only.
However, in the light of the exclusion of both the above persons
from the paternity of the child, her version seems to be highly
unreliable and lacks credibility.

8. The very fact that the third respondent herein made
allegation of paternity against the petitioner herein and later
against Shiju Yohannan and both of them were excluded from the

paternity of the child,clearly militates against her case of rape.
 2018KERI704
CHLM.C.No 46192017 5

This also shakes at the very root of the case set up by the third
respondent and also makes her version weak and has lost its
credibility.

9. In the above circumstances, contention of the third
respondent that she was subjected to rape by the petitioner herein
has to be clearly doubted. Learned counsel for the petitioner
further pointed out that the third respondent, though alleged that
she was raped in the year 2008 and a child was born in the year
2009, she was subjected to the medical examination after the
complaint was laid. Annexure A8 is the medical report. It
indicates that, there was evidence of recent sexual act. This also
cast serious doubt on the case set up by the third respondent that
she had physical relationship with the petitioner herein some time
in the year 2008.

10. The entire materials on record clearly shows that, the
third respondent has come up with absolutely false case. There are
reasons to believe that it amounts to abuse of process of the court
and the forum of legal adjudication cannot be permitted to be
misused for such frivolous complaint, Even assuming that the
petitioner had physical relationship, in the nature of the materials
collected by the agency, it can only be deemed to be consensual
sex. The criminal proceedings cannot be permitted to continue, to
meet the ends of justice and hence, it is liable to be quashed

without prejudice to the right of the petitioner herein to seek
 2018KERI704
CHLM.C.No 46192017 6

appropriate relief against the third respondent, if he is so advised.
Accordingly, the Cri.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings
in SC No.1518/2015 of the District and Sessions Court, Kollam

arising from Crime No. 4586/2009 of Ezhukon Police station stand

quashed .
