Cri.M.C.No.5 of 2014

Dated this the 2” day of January, 2014
ORDER

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and respondents.

2. Accused Nos.1 & 2 in Crime No.359/2011 of the Kasaragod
Police Station now pending as C.C.No.374/2013 before the Chief
Judicial Magistrate Court, Kasaragod are the petitioners. The
petition is filed seeking to quash further proceedings against the
petitioners in C.C.No.374/2013 on the file of the Chief Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.

3. The offences alleged are punishable under Sections 498(A),
323, 324 read with Section 34 of IPC.

4, The learned counsel on both sides submit that the dispute
between the parties have been amicably settled and having regard
to the resolution of the disputes between the parties, continuance of
the criminal prosecution against the petitioners is an avoidable
irritant.

In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, the
CrLM.C is disposed of quashing further proceedings against the
petitioners in C.C.No.374/2013 on the file of the Chief Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court, Kasaragod.
