Cri.M.C. No.4868 of 2016

Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016

1.A lorry bearing registration No. KL-07-BD-8169 owned by
the 1" petitioner and another lorry bearing Reg.No.KL-36-
8449 belonging to the 3” petitioner was seized by the 2”
respondent on 27.7.2016, alleging commission of offence
under the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining,
Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Transportation Rules, 2015”).

2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any
offence punishable under the said rules can be
compounded, either before or after the institution of the
prosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of

the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,

 2016KERI671

CrILM.C. No.4868 of 2016-2

1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules,
2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to
that offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the
Government, of such sum as that person may specify.
Referring to Annexure-A3, it is submitted that the 3°
respondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint
to the Court or to compound the offence.

3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicles have
not been produced before the 3" respondent till date. The

prayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2”

respondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules,
2105 and to produce the vehicles seized before the 3
respondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued
to the 3% respondent to provide an opportunity to the
petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the
Transportation Rules, 2015.

4.1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.
 2016KERI671

CrILM.C. No.4868 of 2016-3

5.1 find considerable merit in the submission of the learned
counsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the
Transportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of
2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3° respondent
is the competent authority to prefer complaint before the
learned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of
the offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to
secure the ends of justice :~

i, The 2" respondent is directed to produce
the aforesaid vehicles involved in the offence
before the 3% respondent within a period of
two days from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order.

ii, The 3% respondent shall permit the
petitioners to compound the offence under Rule
32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible
under law.

ii. The above endeavour shall be completed
within a period of 5 days from the date of
receipt of this order.
 2016KERI671

CrILM.C. No.4868 of 2016-4

If the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the
Transportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicles
shall be released forthwith. This petition is disposed
off.
