Crl.M.C.No.8498 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioner herein stands arrayed as the sole accused in
Crime No.450 of 2017 of Vadanappally Police Station for offences
punishable under sections 341, 323, 354, 294(b) and 506 of the
Indian Penal Code.

2. It was alleged by the defacto complainant that due to
previous enmity, on 31.03.2017 at 4 p.m, while she was returning
on her scooter after her employment, petitioner herein wrongfully
pushed her down and committed certain acts with the intention of
outraging her modesty. Pursuant to the Fl statement laid by her,
crime was registered and investigation is progressing. In the
meanwhile, Crl.M.C is filed by the petitioner contending that the
dispute is a purely personal dispute and parties have resolved the
dispute with the defacto complainant who is arrayed as the second
respondent.

3. Learned counsel for the second respondent invited my
attention to Annexure-A2, which is an affidavit affirmed by the
second respondent reiterating the settlement. Learned Public
Prosecutor submitted that the settlement has been reported to the

police and the statement of the defacto complainant recorded.

4, Having considered the above facts and the nature of
allegations which discloses only a personal dispute between the
parties and also considering the fact that, there is nothing on record
to show that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime, I
am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash the criminal proceedings to meet the ends of justice.

In the result, Cr.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
arising from Crime No.450 of 2017 of Vadanappally Police Station
will stand quashed.
