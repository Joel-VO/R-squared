BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.355 of 2024

Dated this the 17" day of January 2024

ORDER

Petitioner was issued with a Non Bailable Warrant in three cases
arising under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. She filed
application for recall of warrant in all the three cases. Without even her
presence, the learned Magistrate directed recall of warrant in two cases
noticing that the petitioner is an aged lady and had even taken bail
earlier. However, in S.T.No.963/2022, the learned Magistrate declined to
recall the warrant on noticing that bail had never been taken by the
petitioner. Since petitioner had not been released on bail in the said
case, the learned Magistrate refused to recall the Non Bailable Warrant
without the presence of the petitioner.

2. Sri.C.S.Manu, learned Counsel for the petitioner contended
that due to old age and various ilinesses petitioner is unable to appear
before the Magistrate immediately.

3. SmtSreeja V., learned Public Prosecutor opposed the
application and pointed out that in the impugned order, the learned

Magistrate had considered the distinction with the two other cases and
 224KERIGSS
GRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024

4
refused to recall the warrant, which cannot be said to be perverse.

4. Ona perusal of Annexures A2, A3 and A4 orders, it can be
seen that the learned Magistrate had brought in a distinction in respect
of S.7.963/2022 and refused to recall the warrant on noticing the failure
of the petitioner to take bail in the said case. As rightly pointed out by
the leamed Public Prosecutor, the said order cannot be said to be
perverse, warranting interference of this Court. Therefore, | decline to
interfere with Annexure A4 order.

5. On noticing the disinclination of this Court to interfere with
‘Annexure A4 order, learned Counsel for the petitioner sought time to
appear before the Court to take bail and requested for keeping the
coercive proceedings in abeyance, lest petitioner be put to serious
prejudice.

6. Considering the old age of the petitioner and also the limited
relief now pressed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, this Court is
of the opinion that coercive proceedings can be kept in abeyance to
enable the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate without
fear.

7. Hence while declining to interfere with Annexure A4 order, this
Court directs the Non Bailable Warrant issued in S.T.No.963/2022 to be
kept in abeyance for a period of 15 days from today, within which
period petitioner shall appear before the learned Magistrate and apply

for recall of warrant and for grant of bail. On such application being filed,
 224KERIGSS
GRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024

the same shall be considered by the learned Magistrate on the same day
itselt.

The Crl.MC is disposed of as above.
