THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION

B

The petitioner was convicted and
sentenced by the trial court under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
against which, the petitioner filed appeal.
Along with the appeal, the petitioner filed
Crl.M.P.4548/2018 praying for suspending the
execution of sentence awarded by the trial
court. The court below as per Annexure-A3
order dated 12.12.2018 ordered to suspend
the execution of sentence. The court below
as per Annexure-A3 order inter alia directed
the petitioner to deposit Rs.1 lakh before

the trial court at the time of executing the
 2019KERITO

bond. Aggrieved by the said direction, this
Crl.M.C. has been filed.

2. Heard.

3. The trial court sentenced the
petitioner to simple imprisonment for one
year and a fine of Rs.10 lakh under Section
138 of the N.I.Act. Section 148 of the
N.I.Act provides that notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, in an appeal by the drawer
against conviction under Section 138, the
Appellate Court may order the appellant to
deposit such sum which shall be minimum of
twenty per cent of the fine or compensation
awarded by the trial court. In this case,

the court below directed only to deposit
 2019KERITO

Rs.1 lakh, which is only ten per cent of the
compensation awarded by the trial court. In
the said circumstances, I do not find
anything to interfere with Annexure-A3 order

passed by the appellate court.

In the result, this Cri.M stands
dismissed.
