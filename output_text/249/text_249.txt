2024KERHIOI6

ORDER
The petitioner herein is the Sth accused in Crime
No.111/CR/EKM/2011, CBCID, Ernakulam, invoking inherent
jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for a
direction for an early disposal of SC No.682 of 2023, pending
before the IInd Additional District and Sessions Court,

Ernakulam.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner would subr that
the petitioner is a 71 year old man, and so trial of the case
has to be expedited for disposing it on an early date.

3. Learned Public Prosecutor would point out that the
sessions case is of the year 2023 and so, the trial court may
not be able to give an early posting for this case,
superseding the old cases pending consideration of that
court.

4. Since the petitioner is aged 71 years, the trial court

has to see whether any priority can be given to that case for

disposal on an early date, as he is a senior citizen.
 C¥LM.C.No 652/2024 3 ODKERIOIE

Hence, directing the trial court to consider the request
of the petitioner (A5) for early disposal of SC No.682 of
2023, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
