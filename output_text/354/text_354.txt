Cr.M.C.No.3282 of 2010

Dated this the 23" day of January, 2014.

ORDER

Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Petitioner is
the sole accused in a complaint case filed before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal, numbered as
C.CNo.1092 of 2008. The offence alleged against the
petitioner herein is one punishable under Section 500 of the

Indian Penal Code (in short, “IPC”). Annexure A is the

complaint.

2. Allegation is that the Malayalam Daily by name
"Malayala Manorama’ published a news item on 12.04.2006 with
A caption “asSleeyO ayshw avielow carafaflay’. Admittedly, the
petitioner is the editor of the news paper. The complainant/I**
respondent submitted that the statements in the news item are
false and, per se, defamatory to him. Gist of the news item is
that the complainant's mother was locked up in a kennel and she

was in an abandoned state, Local people intervened and rescued

her. It is also mentioned in the news item that the complainant's
mother was labeled as an insane person and illegally confined in
the kennel. Complainant would contend that all those
allegations are false and amounted to defamatory statements.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the
learned counsel for the first respondent and the learned Public
Prosecutor.

4. Learned counsel for the first respondent submitted
that Annexure A complaint revealed an offence of defamation
defined under Section 499 I.P.C. It is also submitted by the

learned counsel that the fact that his mother was locked up in a

kennel itself is a disputed fact. It cannot be resolved in a
proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C, he contended.

5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
contents in the news item squarely fall within the first exception

to Section 499 LP.C. Not only the petitioner’s news paper, but

also other leading news papers had published this news item.

CAM.CN0.3282 of 2010 3

Going by the first exception to Section 499 IPC, it is clear that if
anything is imputed which is true concerning any person, if it be
for the public good that the imputation should be made or
published, then, it is not a defamation, Annexures C and D
would show that other leading Malayalam dailies have also
published the news, Further, in Annexure F reply notice send to
Annexure E lawyer notice, it had been clearly stated that local
television channels have telecasted the wrongful confinement of
the complainant’s mother in a kennel.

6. — It is also contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the petitioner has no role in choosing the local news
item. He is the editor of the daily. Since the editor is not involved in
selecting the news items, he cannot be prosecuted for an offence
under Section 500 IPC. To buttress this contention, the decision in
Mammen Mathew vy. Radhakrishnan (2007 (4) KLT 833) is
pressed into service, Considering the averments in the petition

and on perusing the relevant legal provision, I am of the view
 CAM.CN0.3282 of 2010 4

that the publication herein will squarely fall within the first
exception to Section 499 I.P.C. Consequently, I find that there is
no legal basis for prosecuting the petitioner for the alleged
offence. The prosecution is nothing, but an abuse of the process
of the court.

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure A
complaint pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court ~ I, Attingal is hereby quashed.

Alll pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.
