SUNIL THOMAS, J.

cn ‘M.C.N0.6328 of 2015

Dated this the 3° day of August, 2016
ORDER

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.550 of

2014 of Badiyadukka Police Station for offence punishable under
section 366 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that on 24.11.2014
at about 10 a.m. the accused came in a swift car driven by the
second petitioner and when it reached the check post, the first
petitioner, who was sitting on the rear side of the car, opened the
door and asked the second respondent, who was standing on the
road side, to enter the car, She was then forcefully taken by hand
and pulled into the car by the first petitioner. She was allegedly
abducted with the intention of making sex. In the meanwhile,
police is stated to have intervened and a complaint was taken from
her. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was
aid and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.442 of 2015.

3. The first petitioner herein contended that she was
known to him and that, they were voluntarily travelling in a

vehicle. It was further contended that certain other persons

intervened in the issue and informed the police. To substantiate it,
first petitioner herein had produced certain photographs of the
second respondent individually as well as jointly with her in a
vehicle.

4, The second respondent has now filed an affidavit dated
25.06.2016 swearing that the criminal proceedings were initiated
on the basis of a complaint laid by her. The matter is now settled
between the parties and due to the intervention of her relatives
and other mediators, she has stated that she does not intend to
proceed against the petitioners. Evidently, the affidavit has been
filed by her after having perused the complaint and the
photographs, which have also been produced along with the
crLM.c.

5. In the light of the above, the second respondent had
consciously and knowingly stated that she has no grievance
against the petitioners, thereby affecting the substratum of the
prosecution case. Learned counsel for the second respondent also
endorsed the averments in the affidavit and submitted that in the
interest of both sides, the case should be given a decent burial. In
the light of the above submissions and the affidavit filed, I feel that

the matter can be given a quietus.
 2016KERI33896

In the result, Cr.M.C is allowed. Entire proceedings
arising from Crime No.550 of 2014 of Badiyadukka Police Station

stand quashed.
