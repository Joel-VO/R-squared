read over and explained to the accused Nos. 1 to 3 to which they pleaded not

guilty and claimed to be tried.

On the side of prosecution, PW1 was examined and Exhibit P1 was marked.
As the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the leamed
Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CW2 to CW7. In the absence of any
incriminating circumstances against the accused Nos.1 to 3 , questioning of the
accused Nos.1 to 3 , under section 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
‘was dispensed with. Accused Nos. 1 to 3. were called upon to adduce

2

(4) If the accused Nos. 1 to 3 are found guilty? What is the order as to

punishable under sections 294(b), 506(i) and 509 read with section 34 of

Indian Penal Code, 1860.

9. PW, Rejani Anil deposed that she had given complaint to the police regarding the alleged
incident of this case. She admitted her signature in the Ext P1 statement . She
deposed that accused persons were not assaulted her and she has no grievance

against the accused persons .

10. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and she

is justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of
 506

prosecution, Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view
that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused Nos 1 to 3 and for the

said reason these points are found against the prosecution.

to 3 are found not guilty of offences punishable under sections 294(b), 506(i)

Code 1973. Their bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
