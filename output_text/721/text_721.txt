 B.KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.1654 of 2015 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-tI, Kollam, which has
arisen from Crime No.130 of 2014 of the Pallithottam Police
Station, registered for the offences punishable under Sections
294(b), 341 and 323 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably settled
between the parties.

3. On going through the facts and circumstances of
the case, it seems that the matter can be permitted to be
settled. It has been reported that no criminal antecedents
have been reported against the petitioner. The defacto
complainant has filed Annexure-A3, affidavit affirming that the
matter has been amicably settled between him and the
petitioner and he has no complaints against the petitioner.
Considering the fact that the matter has already been settled

amicably between the parties, this court is satisfied that no
 CrLM.C.No.8665 of 2017 2

purpose would be served in proceeding with the trial of the
case. Matters being so, Annexure-Al First Information Report,
Annexure-A2 Final Report and all further proceedings in
C.C.No. 1654 of 2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court-ll, Kollam, which has arisen from Crime No.130 of 2014
of the Pallithottam Police Station, as against the petitioner,
are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-Al
First Information Report, Annexure-A2 Final Report and all
further proceedings in C.C.No.1654 of 2015 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Kollam, which has arisen
from Crime No.130 of 2014 of the Pallithottam Police Station,

as against the petitioner, are hereby quashed.
