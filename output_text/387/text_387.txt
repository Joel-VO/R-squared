RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J.

Cri.M.C. No.4140 of 2016

Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016

1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in
C.C.No.3003 of 2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First
Class-I, Hosdurg. They are charged with for having
committed offence punishable under Section 506(i) read
with section 34 of the IPC. The 1* respondent is the
victim.

2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the
Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.
State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of
other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v.
State of Punjab and Another [2014) 6 SCC 466] and
 2016KERI660

CrILM.C. No.4140 of 2016

Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand
(2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above
proceeding.

3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above
judgments have delineated the circumstances and the
cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be
invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the
purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed
that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings .

4,It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of
court settlement and there is no acrimony between them
at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved
and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 1*

respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts
 2016KERIA3660

CrILM.C. No.4140 of 2016

that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings.

5.The prosecution allegation is that on 10.8.2013 at about
4.00 p.m., the petitioners had criminally intimidated the
1" respondent and thus committed the offence.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that no other cases are reported against the petitioners.

7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made across the bar and I have also gone through the
materials on record

8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted
that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in
quashing the proceedings as all the disputed between the
parties have been resolved and the parties are living in
peace and harmony. The pendency of the Criminal
proceeding will act as a hindrance to the peace and

harmony which prevail between the parties.
 2016KERI660

CrILM.C. No.4140 of 2016

9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in
nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is
also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of
compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as
the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to
continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility
of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in
putting the de facto complainant and the accused to
unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will
augur well for the interest of the community and will
enable the parties to live in peace and harmony.

10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in
quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case
falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex

Court in

gh (Supra) and the other cases referred

to above.
 CrILM.C. No.4140 of 2016
5

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused
Nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.3003 of 2013 of the Judicial

Magistrate of First Class-I, Hosdurg, shall stand quashed.
