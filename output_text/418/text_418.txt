Cri.M.C No.4642 of 2014

Dated this the 13" January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime
No.3904 of 2011 of Ernakulam Central Police Station,
registered under Sections 326 and 308 of Indian Penal
Code. The case is now pending in committal proceeding
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-Il, Ernakulam
as CP. No.41 of 2012. The defacto complainant,on whose
complaint the crime was registered, is one Rajan. Now the
petitioner seeks orders under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure quashing the prosecution against him
on the ground that he and Rajan have come to terms
amicably out of court. The de facto complainant Rajan is
the 2" respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit
to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the
accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. Of course,
there are materials to attract Section 326 of I.P.C, but I find
no definite material for a prosecution under Section 308 of
LP.C in this case. There is reason to believe that the said

section was incorporated by the Police on the basis of a
 201SKERISO
CH.M.C No.4642 of 2014
hypothetical statement,

2. _ In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable
offences, the High Court can quash prosecution, if the
parties have really settled the dispute, and continuance of
prosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, | find a real
‘and genuine settlement between the parties. In such a
situation, it is definite that continuance of prosecution will

support the

be a sheer waste of time, because nobody
prosecution, if the case goes to trial.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioner herein in Crime No.3904 of 2011 of
Ernakulam Central Police Station, now pending in committal
proceeding before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-
IErmakulam as C.P. No.41 of 2012, will stand quashed
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from
prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will
stand discharged.
