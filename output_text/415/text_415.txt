offences under Section 420 read with 34 IPC. The allegation

against the 1" petitioner is that she had offered to sell a petrol
bunk, being conducted by her in a property, by claiming that
she has every right over the property to convey, through
‘Annexure-A1 agreement. In Annexure-A1 agreement she has
agreed that she would make all the title holders of the property
also as party to the sale deed.

2. According to the petitioners, who are the
accused Nos.1 and 2, they have every right to convey the
property. The defacto complainant and his wife have been
impleaded in the Cri.M.C. as additional respondents 2 and 3.

The learned counsel for the said respondents submits that the

defacto complainant has been deliberately cheated through

CCrLM.C.No.4594 of 2016 2
‘Annexure-A1 agreement and the money has not been so far
returned. It has been argued that the petitioners have no
right to convey the property.

3. The present arguments forwarded by the learned
counsel for the petitioners cannot be considered by this Court
at this stage. Those matters have to be decided by the court
below at appropriate stage.

With liberty to the petitioners to take up all these
