ORDER
Dated this the 8" day of January , 2024

This Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is
filed by the 3" accused in crime No.778 of 2005 of Tirur
Police Station, Malappuram, which is now pending before
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur, as L.P.C.No.1 of
2017, for a direction to the Magistrate to release him on
bail on the date of surrender itself.

2. According to the petitioner, he stands charge
sheeted, along with 3 other accused persons, for offences
punishable under Sections 468, 471, 419 and 420 r/w
Section 34 of IPC. The crime is of the year 2005 and the
defacto complainant is now no more. Moreover, the
petitioner and the defacto complainant are relatives and
the matter also stands settled. Since he did not get
summons from the trial court, he could not appear before
the court. Moreover, he was working in Gulf, and so he

failed to appear before the court, and so his case was

transferred to long pending register. Now, he wants to
surrender before the trial court and his prayer is to direct
the Magistrate to release him on bail on the date of
surrender itself.

Adverting to the facts and circumstances, this
Court is inclined to direct the petitioner to surrender before
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur on or before
31.01.2024, and his application for bail, if any, has to be
considered by learned Magistrate positively on the date of
surrender itself, and learned Magistrate has to pass
appropriate orders, taking into account the factual
situations pleaded by him. In order to facilitate the
petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate court, the
non-bailable warrant now pending against the petitioner
shall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.2024.

With these directions this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
