Cri.M.C. No.34 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2017

ORDER

1.This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.771 of 2016 of
Ramamangalam Police Station registered on the basis of
information furnished by the 2™ respondent, a minor girl,
aged 16 years, alleging commission of offence under
Sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual

Offences Act, 2012.

3.The petitioner is a Post Graduate student at M.A.College,
Kothamangalam. He used to work as a swimming
instructor at the MTMHS College, Piravom. The 2™

respondent was a student studying for the plus two course
 2017KERRIS
Cri.M.C.34/2017 2

in the said college. The prosecution allegation is that the
petitioner took the 2" respondent to Piravom park and
also to Issac Theatre, Muvattupuzha and committed

sexual assault.

4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits
that the crime was registered on account of some
misconception and after the registration of the crime, the
parties have sat together and have settled the disputes
amicably. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3
affidavit signed by the 3" respondent , who is the mother
of the 2" respondent, to bring home the point that the
minor child or the mother has any grievance against the

accused.

5.The learned Public Prosecutor would vehemently oppose
the submission of the learned counsel and submit that the
offence is grave and it will not be in the interest of justice
to quash the proceedings on a purported settlement with

the mother of the minor girl.
 2017KERRIS
CrLM.C.34/2017 3

6.1 have considered the rival submissions and have

anxiously perused the records .

7.Act 32 of 2012 was enacted to prevent the increasing
number of sexual offences against children and to give
adequate punishment to the offenders and to protect the
right of the children guaranteed by the U.N. Convention
on Right of Child , 1989 and the Constitution of India. The
2 respondent was aged 16 years at the relevant point of
time and the allegation would prima facie disclose a case
of sexual assault. The offence committed by the accused is
an offence against the society and it is not a matter to be
left for the parties to compromise and settle. As the victim
was a minor girl, this Court cannot be assured that the
consent given is genuine. In cases such as this, the
accused will utilize all the resources at his command to
pressurize the family members for a compromise. The
offence is grave and in that view of the matter, I am

unable to accept the compromise arrived at to quash the
 2017KERRIS
CrLM.C.34/2017 4

proceedings.

8.It appears from the case diary that the Investigating
officer has not so far taken steps to record the statement
of the child by a Magistrate. The crime was registered on
6.8.2016, and the delay that has occasioned cannot be
countenanced. The officer concerned is directed to
expedite the proceedings and to submit the final report

before Court.

9.1 find no merit in this petition and the same will stand

dismissed .
