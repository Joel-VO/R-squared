Crl.M.C.No.4681 of 2017

Dated this the 6" day of December, 2017
ORDER

Petitioner herein, aggrieved by the dismissal of her

application under section 302 Cr.P.C has approached this Court.
Petitioner herein is the de facto complainant in C.C.No.1930 of
2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kadakkal
(Temporary). It appears that, there was a counter case as C.C.No.9
of 2014, in which, CW1 was the de facto complainant. In that case,
Annexure-Al application under section 302Cr.P.C was laid on a
premise that since CW1 in C.C.No.9 of 2014 was the accused in
C.C.No.1930 of 2015 and if it is conducted by the same Assistant
Public Prosecutor, there is likelihood of prejudice.

2. Court below, after hearing the petitioner herein and the
learned Assistant Public Prosecutor dismissed the application after
perusing the files. It was found by the learned magistrate that,
Assistant Public Prosecutor of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Punalur was to conduct the prosecution in C.C.No.9 of 2014
Other connected case was conducted by another Public Prosecutor.
Court below rightly concluded that, since the case and counter case
are handed by different Public Prosecutors, no prejudice will be

caused to the victim in the case and there is no likelihood of
 2017KERID283

miscarriage of justice. Evidently, the apprehension of the petitioner
herein stand allayed by the very fact that two separate Assistant
Public Prosecutors are conducting the cases. Having considered
this, I find no ground for challenge in the case.
CrLM.C fails and is dismissed.
