‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 2539 of 2016

Dated this the 1” day of June, 2016
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.62/2009
of the Pandikkad Police Station registered for offences punishable
under Sections 323, 324 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was
registered and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.274/2009
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate - 1, Perinthalmanna.
According to the parties, the dispute between the parties has
been settled amicably and a compromise has been arrived at. It
was submitted by both sides that they do not propose to proceed
with the case. Annexure B to F are the affidavits sworn to by
respondents 2 to 6 herein who are the victims/injured.

3. It was brought to my notice that a counter case was
also initiated as Crime No.61/2009 resulting in C.C. No.275/2009
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna. It
was submitted by both sides that the above case was quashed by
order of this Court in cri.M.C. No.1925/2016 dated 08.04.2016. A

copy of the order was also made available.

Cri. M, C. No, 2539 of 2016

4, It is eminently clear that the parties have settled their
disputes amicably. Hence the continuance of further proceedings
can also result in manifest injustice to the parties, Hence | am
inclined to allow the Cri.M.C., quashing entire proceedings in C.C.
No.274/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-ll,
Perinthalmanna

Crl.M.C. stands allowed.
