CRL.M.C.No. 5465 of 2020

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2021
ORDER

Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.315 of 2018 of
Kilikolloor Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under
Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, now pending as
C.C.No.766 of 2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-l, Kollam. The prosecution allegation is that by about 2 p.m on
8.5.2018, the petitioner was found in front of Kilikolloor Police Station,
in an inebriated and quarrelsome condition, which was likely to cause
breach of peace. The petitioner seeks to get the further proceedings in
the case against him quashed primarily on the ground that even if the
allegations are accepted in their entirety, the alleged offence was not
made out.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in order to
attract the offence under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act, the
accused should have been in a public place and in an intoxicated
manner or rioting condition or incapable of looking after himself.
Referring to Annexure Il final report, it is contended that the allegation

is only of petitioner being found in a quarrelsome condition, unable to
 cet.mc. 5465/2020 a 202UKEREIS

stand on his own and using abusive language. It is submitted that the
definition of the term ‘rioting’ not being available under the Kerala
Police Act, the definition provided under Section 146 of IPC ought to
be adopted. It is further contended that, unless blood test is conducted
and the alcohol content in the blood found to be in excess of the
permitted level, a person cannot be held to be in an intoxicated
condition. It is pointed out that even going by the prosecution case,
only breath analyzer test was conducted, for which also there is no
documentary evidence. The learned counsel submitted that the
petitioner has been advised for appointment as Police Constable and
was not sent for training on account of his implication in the criminal
case.

3. I find substantial force in the contentions urged by the learned
counsel. A vague allegation of the petitioner being found in a
quarrelsome condition will not attract the offence under Section
118(a). There is essential difference between quarrelsome and rioting
conditions. Further, there is no evidence to prove that the petitioner
was in an intoxicated condition, except the statement that he was
unable to stand on his own. Hence, further proceedings in the case
based on such unsubstantiated and vague allegations amount to an

abuse of process of court.

In the result, the Cri.M.C is allowed. Further proceedings in
C.C.No.766 of 2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court, Kollam is quashed.
