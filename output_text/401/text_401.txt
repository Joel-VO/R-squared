RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J.

Cri.M.C. No.4378 of 2016

Dated this the 3° day of August, 2016

1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 to 4 in
C.C.No.360 of 2016 of the Judicial Magistrate of First
Class-II, Aluva. They are charged for having committed
offence punishable under Sections 448 and 323 read with
34 of the IPC. The 2" respondent is the victim.

2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the
Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.
State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of
other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v.
State_of Punjab and anr. [2014) 6 SCC 466] and
Yogendra_ Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand
 2016KERII881
CrlLM.C. No.4378 of 2016 2

[2014 (9) SCC 653] with a prayer to quash the above
proceeding.

3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above
judgments have delineated the circumstances and the
cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be
invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the
purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed
that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings .

4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of
court settlement and there is no acrimony between them
at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved
and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 2°
respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts
that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings.

5.The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on 17.4.2016,

the petitioners had assaulted the 2” respondent and
 2016KERII881
CrlLM.C. No.4378 of 2016 3

caused injuries.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that no other cases of heinous nature are reported against
the petitioners.

7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made across the bar and I have also gone through the
materials on record

8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted
that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in
quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between the
parties have been resolved and the parties are living in
peace and harmony .

9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in
nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is
also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of
compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as
the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to

continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility
 2016KERII881
CrlLM.C. No.4378 of 2016 “4

of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in
putting the de facto complainant and the accused to
unwanted oppression and prejudice, Settlement will augur
well for the interest of the community and will enable the
parties to live in peace and harmony.

10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in
quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case
falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex
Court in Gian Singh (Supra) and the other cases referred
to above.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused
Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.No.360 of 2016 of the Judicial
Magistrate of First Class-II, Aluva are quashed.
