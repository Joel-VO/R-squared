THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 2024KERIS269

CrL.M.C. No.722 of 2024

Dated this the 23" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioner seeks for the relief of adjournment of the trial in

$.C.No.582/2017 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court-

Ill, Mavelikkara by six months.
. Petitioner is CW2 in the above case. Petitioner is in detention

under NDPS Act, and he asserts that he wil

not be able to
give proper guidance for the conduct of the case.

‘The prosecution alleges that on 31.01.2014 the accused had
attacked the defacto complainant and another person and
thereby committed the offences under Sections 143, 144, 147,

148, 149, 324 and 326 of the Indi

in Penal Code, 1860 apart
from Section 20 r/w Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959,

- Petitioner is an accused in several crimes, including three NDPS
cases, and is now under detention. He contends that he will

not be able to conduct the case properly and give proper
 2024KERIS269

assistance to the prosecutor, and therefore, wants an
adjournment of the trial by six months. It is also. submitted
that, if the petitioner is permitted to give evidence in the trial,
after he is released from detention, he would be able to
effectively participate in the trial.

5. Having heard Smt.A.Salini Lal, the learned counsel for the
petitioner, as well as Sri,Ashi.M.C,, the learned Public
Prosecutor, I am of the view that the relief sought for by the
petitioner has no merit.

6. The prosecution is primarily conducted by the prosecutor. The
investigation has already been completed, and all the materials
required for a proper trial have been collected. Though the
petitioner is an injured and a witness in the case, he can only
provide evidence when called upon to do so. Notwithstanding
the fact that petitioner is in detention under the NDPS Act, on
the date fixed for evidence, necessary arrangements will be
made to enable the court to record his evidence. Petitioner
cannot, at this stage, go around collecting evidence or provide

any additional material to the prosecutor or to the
 2024KERIS269

investigation, Therefore, the contention that the petitioner will

be able to assist the prosecutor more effectively if he is
released from detention and, on that basis, the trial ought to
be adjourned is highly untenable. Hence, I do not find any
merit in those contentions, and this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.

7. Notwithstanding the above dismissal, it will be open to the
prosecutor, if he feels it necessary to make any application for
adjournment of the trial, to do so.
