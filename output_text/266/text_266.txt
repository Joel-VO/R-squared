PA TO JUDGE

‘sae/~
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Petitioners are A2, A3, A4 and AG in CC
No. 1979/2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,
Angamaly, based on Annexure-8 final report in Crime
No.172/2015 of Angamaly Police Station for the offences
punishable under Sections 297 and 201 read with Section
34 IPC.

2. On going through the allegations in the final
report, it has come out that the offence under Section 297
IPC cannot be attracted. As far as the offence under
Section 201 IPC is concered, when the other offence
cannot be attracted, there cannot be an offence under
Section 201 IPC also. Matters being so, the prosecution of

the petitioners in the case is quite unnecessary and
 CALM.C.1183/2016

therefore, all further proceedings in CC No.1979/2015 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Angamaly, based
on Annexure-8 final report in Crime No.172/2015 of
Angamaly Police Station are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Cr.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings against the petitioners in CC No.1979/2015 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Angamaly, based
on Annexure-8 final report in Crime No.172/2015 of
Angamaly Police Station, are quashed.
