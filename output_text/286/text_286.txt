Crl.M.C. No.1989 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.294/2015 of
Alathur Police Station. He is the Secretary of the
Society by name “Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi
Educational Society” (“the Society” for short)
registered under the Societies Registration Act. He is
granted with an anticipatory bail. But he is aggrieved
by condition No.3 in the order granting pre-arrest
bail. According to the petitioner, being the Secretary
of the Society, which is being functioned in the
premises of the school, the condition No.3 prohibiting
his entry into the premises of BSS Sidhasramam or at
the premises of BSS Gurukulam HSS is illegal,
irrational and liable to be deleted. His position as
the Secretary of the Society is evidenced by
Annexure-II order issued by the District Registrar.

But as per condition No.3 of the impugned order he

CHLM.C.1989/15.C

cannot enter into the Society enabling him to
discharge the duties as the Secretary of the Society.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner
and the learned Public Prosecutor.

3, Indisputably, the petitioner is the Secretary
of the Society, as the same is evidenced by
Annexure-II order. If that be so, he has the right to
enter into the Society, which is being functioned in
the premises of the school and he cannot be prevented
from exercising that right. Having regard to the said
facts, condition No.3 in the impugned order will stand
modified to the extent that the petitioner is allowed
to enter into the office of the Society only, which is
being functioned in the premises of the above school:
but he cannot enter into Sidhasramam or BSS
gurukulam HSS.

This petition is disposed of.
