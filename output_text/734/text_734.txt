SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 8737 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
The petitioner was granted bail in Crime No.358/2017 of
Kongad Police Station, Palakkad for offences punishable under
Sections 354(A) of IPC and Section 7 read with 8 and Section 11(i)
read with Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, inter alia on a condition that he shall not enter the
limits of the village where the victim has been staying
2. The petitioner has approached this Court to relax the
condition stating that he is a coolie worker and is doing work near
his house which situates within the village in which the victim
resides. The court below by order in CMP No.3241/2017
dismissed the application seeking relaxation of the above
condition
3. It appears that, having regard to the nature of
allegations and to insulate the victim involved in this case, the
court below has justifiably imposed the condition. However, the

case of the petitioner is that the pet

ioner herein is residing in the
same village. He earns his livelihood by doing sundry works

within that limits, it is submitted,
 aoiwKeRssi2
CC. M.C. No. 8737 of 2017, 2

4, It is seen that the final report has been laid. Having
considered this, | am inclined to permit the petitioner to enter the
limits of the Police Station within whose jurisdiction the petitioner
is residing as evident from the address of the accused. However,
he shall not in any manner threaten, coerce, intimidate or try to
influence the victim or the witnesses.

Crl.M.C. stands disposed of.
