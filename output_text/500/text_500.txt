Ce1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (11

ORDER

Dated this the 4th day of January 2021

Petitioners are the accused in Crime
No.831/2019 registered at the Nadakkavu Police
Station for offences punishable under Sections 143,
147, 148, 323, 324 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as
C.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode. The de facto
complainant and the other persons injured are
arrayed as respondents 3 to 5. Annexures-A3 to AS
affidavits have been filed by the said respondents
stating that the dispute, which was the reason for
the incident and registration of the crime, has been
resolved amicably and they no subsisting grievance

against the petitioners.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,
who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners
have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences
alleged, nature of the injury caused and having
perused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 to 5, the
contents of which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled
and no public interest is involved in this matter. The
fact that both petitioners as well as the de facto
complainants were students is also taken into
consideration. Moreover, in view of the settlement,
possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in
conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of
court and hence, in view of the legal position set out

by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan
 Ce1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (Hi 5.

Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC
582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and
another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no
impediment in granting the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The
proceedings in C.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode is
quashed.
