CrI.M.C. No. 25 of 2014

Dated this the 02" day of January, 2014

ORDER

This is a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
seeking to have all further proceedings in C.C.No. 1117 of
2013 pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,
Kannur quashed.

2. The petitioner stands accused of having
committed the offence punishable under Section 354(A) of
IPC in Crime No. 850/2013 of Kannur Town Police Station.
After investigation, final report was laid and cognizance of
the offence was taken as C.C.No. 1117 of 2013.

3. Itis unnecessary to go into the facts and details of
the case for the simple reason that the petitioner has chosen

to i

plead the defacto complaint/victim as the second
respondent who has entered appearance through a counsel
and who accepts that the Annexure-A2 affidavit filed along

with this petition is one sworn to by the second respondent

herself and she stands by the statements contained therein.

4. On going through affidavit, it is seen that the
parties have settled all their differences and issues between
them and the victim has no further grievance in the matter.
It is pointed out that she is disinterested in continuing the
proceedings.

6. In the light of the above stand taken by the de
facto complainant, it is felt that continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

Hence, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings
in C.C.No. 1117 of 2013 pending before Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-!, Kannur including the final report based
‘on which cognizance was taken shall stand quashed and the

petitioner shall stand discharged.
