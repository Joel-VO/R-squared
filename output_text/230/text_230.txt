Cri. M.C No.457 of 2013

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2015.

ORDER
The petitioner herein is the accused in a prosecution brought
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the
Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kolenchery, by the second
respondent herein. As the complaint was delayed by 22 days, the
second respondent filed C.M.P 375/2012 for condonation of the
delay. The petitioner herein entered appearance, and resisted the
application to condone delay. On being satisfied of the reason
stated for delay in the affidavit the learned Magistrate condoned the
said delay as per the order dated 8.6.2012 in C.M.P 375/2012.
Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner approached the court of
Session, Ernakulam with Cri. R.P 100/2012. Finding no merit in the
case advanced by the petitioner, the learned Sessions Judge
dismissed the Crl.R.P 100/2012 on 10/12/2012. The said order is
under challenge in this proceeding brought under Section 482
crP.c.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on Kishco Ltd

(M/s.) v. K.A Vincent @ Wilson Alex and Another 2012 (3)
 2019KERAS

Crt. M.CNo.457 of 2013 2

KHC 495. The said decision cannot be mechanically applied to all
cases. What exactly is the reason for delay, or whether such reason
is acceptable, or whether the delay stands explained, are all factors
varying from case to case. A straight jacket formula regarding the
circumstances in which delay can be condoned, or the grounds that
can be accepted for condonation of delay, cannot be made by
precedents, In this case the delay is really very short, and it is of
only 22 days. The amount involved in the case is Rs.13,00,000/-
(Rupees Thirteen lakhs). In such a circumstance, the request to
condone delay cannot be mechanically approached. If such an
approach is made and the short delay is not condoned, the accused
will stand benefited, probably unlawfully. Discretion in the matter of
delay cannot be exercised in favour of such persons and in such

circumstances. In this case I find that there is sufficient and

satisfactory explanation for the delay, and that decision in the
matter of delay was properly, legally and rightly taken by the courts
below. I find no reason or ground to interfere.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.

P.UBAID,
JUDGE
