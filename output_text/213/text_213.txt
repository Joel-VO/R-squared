CFLM.C.No.324 of 2024

BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.324 of 2024

Dated this the 12 day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioner contends that despite an application filed by the
investigation officer to delete the petitioner as an accused in
C.C. No.704/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Mavelikara, the learned Magistrate has not passed appropriate orders
thereon.

2. A perusal of Annexure-AS reveals that the Deputy Superintendent
of Police of Crime Branch, Alappuzha, had filed an application to delete the
petitioner form the party array in C.C. No.704/2020, as early as on
03.11.2021. If orders on the said application have not been issued so far,
petitioner is certainly justified in approaching this Court seeking the reliefs
{as sought for in this criminal miscellaneous case.

3. In view of the above, there will be a direction to the Judicial First

Class Magistrate Court-l, Mavelikar

to consider the application filed in
CC. No.704/2020 on 03.11.2021, copy of which is produced as
‘Annexure-AS, at the earliest and without further delay.
CFLM.C. is disposed of as above.
