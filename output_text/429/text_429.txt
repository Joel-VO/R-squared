Cri. M.C. No.4816 of 2015

® day of January, 2018

Dated this the 4'

ORDER

The following prayers are made in this Crl.M.C.:-

*i) Direct the 3% respondent not to arrest the
petitioner in connection with S.T.No.1477/2005 on
the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Kochi.

ii) Grant three months time to the petitioner to
report satisfaction of the amount due to the 1*
respondent in connection with S.T.No.1477/2005 on
the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-Ill,
Kochi and

iii) To pass such other orders or reliefs as this
Hon'ble Court deems fit in the interest of justice.”

2. The revision petitioner was convicted and
sentenced by the trial court under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act (in short, ‘the N.l.Act'). The
above said conviction and sentence were confirmed in
appeal. In the revision petition filed against the conviction

and sentence, this Court as per Annexure-Al order dated
 2018KERDAS
Cri. M.C, No.4826 of 2015,

11.07.2008 in  Crl.R.P.No.2330/2008 confirmed the
conviction and modified the sentence to a fine of
Rs.4,00,000/- with a default clause for simple
imprisonment for three months. A period of seven
months was granted to the petitioner to pay the fine.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.

4. In this Cri.M.C., the second prayer has become
infructuous due to the passage of time. In view of the
direction of this Court as per Annexure-Al order, if the
amount is not paid, the petitioner will naturally be
arrested in execution of the sentence. However, in view
of the decision of this Court in Subhash Sait v. Sree
Gokulam Chits and Finance, Palakkad & Another [2015
(4) KHC 741], there is no need to pass any order by this
Court for the petitioner to pay the fine even after the
period stipulated by this Court as per Annexure-Al order.
However, the warrant will be kept in abeyance for a period
of fifteen days from today, to enable the petitioner to pay

the fine.

Cri. M.C, No.4826 of 2015,

In the result, this Cri.M.C. stands disposed of as

above.
