2. This case stands posted for the evidence of the Petitioner since 21.05.2022.
‘There were change in Vakalat of the Petitioner on 23.09.2022 and thereafter there was

ro representation of the Petitioner. Pursuant to issuance of registered notice, the
Petitioner appeared on 14.08.2023 and informed that she is unable to prosecute the
case and Protection Officer was directed to meet the Petitioner. The Complainant was
absent continuously on subsequent postings, ie, on 17.11.2023, 27.12.2023,
(09.02.2024, 16.02.2024, 27.042024. The Respondent was duly represented on the
above postings except on 17.11.2023 and 27.04.2024. The evidence was adjourned to
 07.06 2024 on request of the Petitioner's Counsel on 27.04.2024, on which date, she
‘was absent and time granted again to adduce evidence on 15.06.2024. Fresh Vakalat
‘was filed on her behalf on the said date and evidence was adjourned to 20.07.2024,
‘on which date there was no representation on her behalf, but she personally
appeared before this Court and raised grievance that she be allowed to withdraw the
case and stated that she is already represented by a Legal Aid Counsel and denied
suggestion to appoint another Legal Aid Counsel. This Court had addressed the
Hon'ble DLSA with the above matter along with the letter submitted by her. On
subsequent postings, there was no representation on her behalf by the Counsel who
hhad filed fresh vakalat on her behalf and nor was she present before this Court
Notice was issued to her through Protection Oificer and the Protection Officer
reported that the notice has been affixed on her house on 30.08.2024. Further
‘opportunity was granted to the Petitioner for her appearance on 15.11.2024, but she
did not turn up before this Court. A fair opportunity was granted to the Petitioner
to appear before this Court and to adduce evidence as No further Time and matter
‘was adjourned to 18.11.2024. However, despite the presence of the Respondent,
neither the Petitioner nor her Counsel turned up before this Court. On enquiry with
the Hon’ble DLSA, it was ascertained that panel lawyer had been appointed for

conducting her case.

3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities to
the Petitioner to adduce evidence as elucidated above, when the matter was taken up
this day, the Petitioner remained absent. There was no representation for the
Petitioner. The Accused was present and represented by their Counsel. The
Responclent has been continuously represented throughout. Umpteen opportunities
have been granted to the Petitioner. Neither is the Petitioner present before this Court
nor is she represented by her Counsel and no bonafide reason stated for the non-
appearance of the Complainant.

In wake of the above circumstances, it appears to this Court that the Petitioner
does not intend to proceed with the above matter further and her unexplained
absence fortifies the same. Hence, on the said satisfaction, this Court finds it
inappropriate to continue this proceeding any further in the absence of the Petitioner,
 as the same is only a futile exercise; taking into account the stage of the case and.
serious prejudice that would be caused to the Respondent, if matter is proceeded
further in the said scenario. Therefore, this MC is dismissed for default of the
Petitioner and for want of Prosecution.

4. Resultantly, this MC is dismissed for default of the Petitioner and for want of
Prosecution.

Pronounced in open court on this the 18" day of November, 2024,
