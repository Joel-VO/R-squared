‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 2631 of 2016

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2017
ORDER
When the matter was taken up, it was submitted by the
learned counsel for the petitioner that, the court has framed the
charge which he proposes to challenge. A copy application has
also been applied. It was contended that the court did not take
into consideration the impact of the contention based on Section
197 Cr.P.C. which was referred to in Annexure A3 order of this

Court and the impact of the Civil Court judgment in the present

proceedings. Since it appears that the petitioner proposes to
seek comprehensive relief, the present Cri.M.C. is closed keeping

‘open his all options.

SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.
