THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD OW
11.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 cele. 3939 OF 2020 (8) 202UKERIOOS

ORDER

The challenge is against Annexure Al private
complaint and the cognizances taken by the
Magistrate thereof mainly on the reason that no
sworn statement of the defacto complainant was
taken under Section 200 Cr.P.c. When the matter
taken up today, the learned counsel fairly
submitted that the statement was recorded on the
reverse side of the original complaint and hence

they are not pressing the Crl.M.c.

The Crl.M.c. is dismissed as not pressed.
without prejudice to the right of the petitioners
to take all their contentions and remedies at the

various stages of the proceedings.
