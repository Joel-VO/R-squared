Cri.M.C.No.5593 of 2020

Dated this the 7® day of January, 2021

ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.52 of 2019
registered at the Edathala Police Station for the offence
punishable under Sections 323, 341 r/w 34 of IPC, now pending
as C.C.No.254 of 2019 on the files of Judicial First Class
Magistrate-I, Aluva. The de facto complainant at whose instance
the crime was registered is the 1" respondent. Annexure A3
affidavit has been filed by the 1* respondent, stating that the

dispute has been settled and that he has no subsisting grievance

against the petitioners.
2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on

instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal

antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,
nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed
by the 1* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be
true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and

that no public interest is involved in this matter. The fact that
 2020KERIOO8

the petitioners as well as defacto complainant were Law
students when the incident occurred is also taken into

consideration. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of

the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such,

continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out
by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.

State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no

impediment in granting the relief sought.

4. In the result, this Cri.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in
C.C.No.254 of 2019 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate-
1, Aluva is quashed.
