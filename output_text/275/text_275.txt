Crl.M.C.No.1630 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.827/2016 of the

Judicial First Class Ma

rate's Court, Muvattupuzha based on
Annexure-B final report in Crime No.561/2016 of the
Muvattupuzha Police Station for the offence under Section
506(i) IPC. On hearing either sides, it seems that the
arguments forwarded by the learned counsel for the petitioner
cannot be considered at present, since those arguments are
based on the merits of the case. The petitioner can take up all
these contentions before the trial court at appropriate stage.

With liberty to the petitioner to take up these
contentions at appropriate stage before the trial court, this
Cr1.M.C. is disposed of. As far as practicable, the court below
shall grant exemption to the petitioners from personal
appearance.
