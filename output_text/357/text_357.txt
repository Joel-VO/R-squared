CrLM.C.No.3342 OF 2013

Dated this the 13 day of January, 2017

ORDER

This is a case where a complaint was filed by the HDFC bank,
Palarivattom before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No.1,
Ettumanoor. Now the case is pending as C.C.No.271/2009 before the
said court. The petitioners! case is as follows :

The first petitioner availed a loan from the complainant bank to
purchase an excavator. Now, the amount due is Rs.7,00,000/-.. When
the petitioner defaulted instalments, the above said complaint is filed
alleging that the excavator was transferred to the second petitioner and
also that material alterations are made on the vehicle. Thereafter, the
second petitioner appeared before the court and stated by an affidavit

that he had not purchased the vel

le and he got no right over the

vehicle. It is also the case of the petitioner that the loan amount has

been repaid, Notice issued to the complainant who is shown as
 2017™KERD.O7S

CHLM.C.No 33422013, 2

respondent No.2 before this court. No representation for the said bank
for today before this court. There is nothing to disbelieve the case of

the petitioner that the above said Rs.7,00,000/- was repaid.

2. The only question before this court is that whether there is
ingredients to attract an offence under Section 420 of IPC. It can be
seen that the bank got no case that at the time of availing the loan itself,
the petitioner was having criminal intention to cheat the bank and avail
Rs.7,00,000/- and thereafter not to repay the amount. It appears that
the grievance was that the vehicle was transferred to the second
petitioner and thereafter repayments were defaulted. When the
ingredients of an offence under Section 420 is lacking, there will be no
necessity to proceed with a case like this. Admittedly, the complainant

is a financial institution which is advancing amounts to the persons

requesting and entitled for the same, There is no case that any forged
document was produced or false representation was made so as to avail
the loan. In the charge sheet also, it is stated as follows :
