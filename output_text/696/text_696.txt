SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.8505 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
Petitioner herein is arrayed as the 5" accused in Crime
No.510 of 2011 of Puthencruz Police Station for offences punishable
under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 506(ii), 294(b) and 149
of the Indian Penal Code.

2. Ibis alleged that, due to enmity between two factions of
@ community, on 24.12.2011 at 11.30a.m, accused formed into an
unlawful assembly, pulled out the defacto complainant from his car,
abused him and hit him. Specific overt acts were attributed to the
accused. Accordingly, crime was registered and after investigation,
final report was filed. The matter was taken cognizance of and was
pending before the Additional District and Sessions Court,
Emakulam as $.C.No.22 of 2014. Accused, except the petitioner
herein, faced the trial before the court below. Learned Sessions
Judge by Annexure-4 acquitted all the accused.

3. Petitioner herein has filed this Cri.M.C on a premise
that, in the light of the acquittal of the remaining accused by virtue
of Annexure-4 judgment, the substratum of the entire prosecution
case stands broken and no purpose will be served by prosecuting

the petitioner herein. It is further contended that the matter was
 2018KERISOS

settled with the defacto complainant and the injured evidenced by
Annexures-5 and 6 affidavits. Learned counsel for the second and
third respondents acknowledged the due execution of the above
affidavits and submitted that, they have no objection in quashing the
proceedings. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that Annexure-4 was not subject to any appeal and has become
final. It is also submitted that the defacto complainant has informed
orally that he has executed the affidavits. Annexure-4 judgment
shows that, after the examination of PWi, Court found that, he did
not stand by the prosecution case. He only said that a group of
people assaulted him. He could not identify them. He categorically
deposed that the accused therein did not assault him. Having
considered the specific version of PW1, learned Public Prosecutor
gave up all the remaining witnesses. Consequently, accused, who
faced the trial, were acquitted under section 232 of Cr.P.C

4, It is evident that, with this quality of evidence tendered
before the trial court, a successful prosecution of the petitioner
herein is not possible. Having considered these facts, I am inclined
to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the

entire criminal proceedings as against the petitioner herein.

5. It is pertinent to note that the incident happened in the
year 2011. Petitioner herein remained absent from the judicial
proceedings though all other accused faced the trial. It was
submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he was
abroad for earning his livelihood. Having considered these facts, I
am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash the criminal proceedings subject to conditions.

In the result, Cr.M.C will stand allowed and all further
proceedings in $.C.No.902 of 2016 of the Additional District and
Sessions Court, Ernakulam as against the petitioner herein will
stand quashed on condition that the petitioner herein deposits a
sum of Rs.2,000/- (Rupees two thousand only) within a period of 15
days from today with the Kerala Legal Services Authority,

Emakulam and file proof before this Court.
