BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.230 of 2024

Dated this the 22” day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner challenges the registration of Crime No.125/2023 of
Vellikulangara Police Station, Thrissur District, alleging offences punishable
under Sections 324, 448, 447 and 506 rw Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860,

2. According to the prosecution, on 26.02.2023, the accused
trespassed into the residence of the defacto complainant and destroyed
the window panes and the door of his house and in that process the
defacto complainant suffered injuries and thereby the accused committed

the offences alleged.

3. Sri. Gautham krishna E J, the learned counsel for the petitioner
contended that the entire prosecution allegations are false and the crime
has been registered as a counter blast to Crime No.123/2023 before the
same police station, wherein the defacto complainant's son had
trespassed into the house of the accused herein and caused damages and
committed offences under Section 427 and 448 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860. It was further submitted that the allegations in Crime No. 125/2023

are patently false and maliciously instituted. According to the learned
 2024KERIGSI

CFLM.C.No.230 of 2024

counsel, the circumstances warrant invocation of the inherent jurisdiction
under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the proceedings.
4. Smt. Sreeja. V, the leamed Public Prosecutor opposed the

application and submitted that the crim

only at the investigation stage
and therefore, the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C ought not to be
invoked.

5. From the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, it is evident that Crime No.123/2023 and Crime No.125/2023
could be treated as case and counter case. However, this Court cannot, at
this stage of the proceedings, arrive at a conclusion as to whether the
allegations are false or not.

6. Further the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked
to quash an FIR only in exceptional circumstances. No such exceptional
circumstances are brought out, despite the vehement contentions raised
by the learned counsel for the petitioner.

Hence, there is no merit in this criminal miscellaneous case and it is
dismissed.
