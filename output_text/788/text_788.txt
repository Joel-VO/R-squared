P.8.70 JUDGE
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 8” day of January, 2018

Petitioners are the accused in CC No.1990/2017
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg,
which has arisen from Crime No.408/2017 of Ambalathara
Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections
341, 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably
settled between the petitioners and the de facto
complainant, who is the 2% respondent herein.
Respondents 3 and 4 are the other injured

3. Respondents 2 to 4 have filed Annexures-Alll,
AIV and AV affidavits respectively, affirming that the matter
has been amicably settled between them and the petitioners
and presently, they have no complaints against the

petitioners. When the matter is settled between the
 (CH.M.C.8978/2017

parties, no purpose would be served in proceeding with the
matter further. Matters being so, all further proceedings
against the petitioners in CC No.1990/2017 of the Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, which has arisen
from Crime No.408/2017 of Ambalathara Police Station, can
be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings against the petitioners in CC No.1990/2017 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Hosdurg, which
has arisen from Crime No.408/2017 of Ambalathara Police
Station, are quashed.
