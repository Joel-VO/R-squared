Cri.M.C.No. 6986 of 2016

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in
C.C.No.557/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Palakkad,
for offence punishable under Section 27 (i) e, (iv) and (i) of Kerala
Forest Act (Amendment Act, 1993), 1961. The crux of the
allegation of the respondent is that, the petitioner herein had
trespassed into the reserve forest, cleared the forest land, erected
concrete fence posts, and thereby caused a loss of Rs.500/- to the
Government. After investigation, final report was laid, for offences
punishable under Sections 27(i) e(iv) and (i) of the Kerala Forest
‘Act, 1961. The learned counsel for the petitioner relying on
‘Annexure 2, title deed contended that the property has been
validly assigned to the petitioner by the above registered
documents and is in absolute possession of the property and that
the land is not a forest land,

2. The learned Special Government Pleader for the forest,

opposing the application, contended that the disputed property is
 201

CrLM.C.No. 6886 of 2016 2

a forest land. According to the counsel, the petitioner herein, had
approached the Forest Tribunal, seeking exemption under
Sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and
Assignment) Act, 1971. The learned counsel for the petitioner
contented that, it was only an alterate prayer in the petition,
Evidently, the question regarding the title, as now raised, is
beyond the scope of consideration under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure. It is essentially for the courts vested with
the appropriate authority, to adjudicate it and decide on the issue,
Hence, I am not inclined to invoke Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The Crl.M.C. fails and therefore, dismissed.
