Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015

Dated this the 24 day of April, 2015,

ORDER

This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the
petitioner to quash the proceedings in C.P.No.145/20104 on
the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Harippad, Alappuzha District.

2. It is alleged in the petition that, the
petitioner has been arrayed as accused in Crime
No.387/2014 of Kareelakulangara police station, alleging
offence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal
Code. According to the petitioner, on 03.04.2014 at about
12.30 p.m., while the petitioner was driving a Volvo Tourist
bus from Bangalore to Thiruvananthapuram and when it
reached Nangiarkulangara at about 12.30 p.m., it collided
with a maruti 800 car, coming from the opposite direction
and in order to avert the car, it hit against the bicycle,

which was crossing the road and five adult persons
 Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015

traveling in the car and a four year child were critically
injured and five persons died. Originally case was
registered under Section 279, 304 and 324 of the Indian
Penal Code. He was arrested on 03.04.2014 and bail was
granted later as per order in B.A.No.3594/2014. Final
report was filed, in which he was charge-sheeted for the
offence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code
and on that basis, case was taken on file as
C.P.No.145/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Harippad. According to the petitioner no
offence under Section 304 or 308 of the Indian Penal Code
have been committed. So he filed this application for
quashing the proceedings.

3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and
Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.

4. According to the counsel, the case was
originally registered for the offence under Section 279, 304

and 324 of the Indian Penal Code and later final report was
 201SKERA7RE

Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015

filed for the offence under Section 304 and 308 of the
Indian Penal Code. According to the learned counsel, the
allegations are not sufficient to attract the offence. It may
be mentioned here that, on going through the allegations,
this court felt that, it is not a fit case to invoke the power
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
quash the proceedings at this stage and the documents
produced by the petitioner are all matters to be considered
by the court below at the time of trial and those documents
cannot be considered at this stage for quashing the
proceedings. It is also settled law that, if a matter has to be
decided on evidence, then, it is not proper for this court to
invoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and quash the proceedings at the initial stage
itself. The petitioner can raise all his contentions before the
trial court after the case is committed to the Sessions Court
and if he files an application for discharge, then that court

can consider those aspects and then pass appropriate
 201SKERA7RE

Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015
4
orders in that application in accordance with law.
With the above direction and observation, the

petition is disposed of. Communicate this order to the

concerned court immediately.
