Cri.M.C. No.3731 of 2016

Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016

ORDER

1. The petitioners herein are accused Nos.1 to 6 in
C.C.No.819 of 2013 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate
of First Class Court-I, Hosdurg. They are charged for
having committed offence punishable under sections 143,
147, 148, 341, 324, 326 read with 149 of the IPC.
Respondents 3 to S are the victims.

2.The prosecution allegation is that on 2.8.2012 at 12.15
a.m., the petitioners formed themselves into an unlawful
assembly and assaulted respondents 2 to 5 with sticks and
other weapons and caused injuries.

3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,
respondents as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.

4.1t is submitted that the parties have reached an out of

cERA6S8
 2010KERI6SS

CaM.c373172016 2
court settlement and there is no acrimony between them
at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved
and they desire to live in peace and harmony.
Respondents 2, 3, 4 and 5 have sworn to separate
affidavits wherein they assert that they have no objection
in terminating the proceedings.

5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that the petitioners are not persons with criminal
antecedents.

6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar
that the parties have amicably settled their disputes by
their own free will and without any kind of pressure,
influence or coercion. The compromise, it is felt, is
voluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon.

7.1In_Gian_Singh_v, State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC
303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of

disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an
 2010KERI6SS

CALM.C.3731/2016 3

end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated
in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC
466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of
Jharkhand and Another (2014 (9) SCC 653).

8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel
and on perusing the records, it appears that the offences
are entirely personal in nature and do not affect public
peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of
proceedings on account of compromise would bring about
peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the
prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any
Purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and
bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto
complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and
prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of
the community and will enable the parties to live in peace
and harmony.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
 CaM.c373172016 4
proceedings against the petitioners, who are accused
Nos.1 to 6 in C.C.No.819 of 2013 on the files of the

Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I, Hosdurg shall

stand quashed.
