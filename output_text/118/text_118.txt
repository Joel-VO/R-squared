Crl.M.C.No.102 of 2016
Dated this the 3” day of January, 2017
ORDER

The pel

ioner_ is the defacto complainant in
CC.No.1072/2009 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Koyilandy for offences punishable under Sections 465,
466, 469, 471 and 417 read with Section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code. The defacto complainant was examined as
PWS. The matter was thereafter posted for hearing. It
seems that at the time of hearing, interpretation was
given by one of the counsel, regarding a sentence in the
deposition of PW2. On the basis of that contentions, an
application to recall PW2 was filed by the APP. The court
below by its order in Annexure-C order dismissed the
application filed under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. This was
carried in revision before the Sessions court in
Cri.R.P.No.105 of 2015. The revisional court accepted the
view taken by the court below and dismissed the revision.

This is under challenge in this Crl.M.C.

Heard both sides and examined the records.
 2017KERAT

CH1.M.C.No,102 of 2016

The disputed sentence is extracted of the order, at page
21. The contentions of both sides before the courts below
as well as before this court revolved around the correct
interpretation and the purport of that portion of
deposition. In the course of deciding the application
under Section 311 of Cr.P.C, both courts were
inadvertently dragged to express their interpretation of
that sentence, which I feel was unnecessary and
unwarranted. Definitely both courts could not have
refrained from venturing into that since the courts were
invited by both sides to render its finding on that portion
of deposition.

3. I feel that this exercise was absolutely
unnecessary in the absence of any allegation that the
evidence of PW2 was not correctly recorded or that there
was any ambiguity in the mode of recording by the court
below. It is for the trial court at the time of final hearing
to decide what exactly did the witness mean by that
portion of deposition. The courts are not expected to cull

out a sentence from the deposition and to give an
 2017KERAT

CH1.M.C.No,102 of 2016 3

opinion, de hors the circumstances under which that
evidence was given. Evidently deposition has to be
appreciated as a whole. By calling upon the court to give
its opinion regarding that sentence, virtually the parties
were preempting the issue which did not arise at that
stage of S.311 Cr.P.C. Having regard to this fact, I feel
that there is no scope for recalling the witness and it is for
the trial court at the time of final hearing to consider the
true intention of the witness, the correct explanation of
that portion of deposition and the circumstances under
which the witness gave that answer. It is to be
independently considered by the trial court, untrammeled
by any observation and any comments made by both the
courts below. In the light of above, this Crl.M.C fails and
is dismissed, The court below shall proceed to pronounce
the judgment on the basis of evidence let it.
