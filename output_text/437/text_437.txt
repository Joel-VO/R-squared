Dated 1* August, 2016

ORDER

1.The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.830 of 2016 on the
files of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class II,
Neyyattinkara. He is charged with and proceeded against
for having committed offence punishable under Section
324 of the IPC.

2.The prosecution allegation is that on 15.4.2016 at 10 am
the petitioner had intentionally dashed his motor bike on
the body of the de facto complainant owing to previous
enmity and caused injuries.

3.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the
learned Public Prosecutor.

4.The learned counsel painstakingly took this court through
the prosecution records and made an attempt to convince
me that even if the prosecution allegations are admitted
as true and correct, the ingredients of the offence under

Section 324 will not be attracted. According to the
 2016KERI673

Cri.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 om

learned counsel the prosecution had no case that the
petitioner had committed the act intentionally or with the
knowledge that it would cause pain. In view of the above
Annexure 8 final report cannot be sustained and prays for
quashing the same. The learned Counsel has relied on a
series of pronouncements of the Apex Court as well as this
Court to advance his contentions.

5.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand submitted
that final report has already been laid and the matter is
now pending before the learned Magistrate. According to
the learned public prosecutor the instant petition filed
under Section 482 of the Code is not liable to be
entertained as the petitioner has an inviolable right to
raise all his contentions before the Court below at the time
of framing of charge and if the learned Magistrate
considers the charge to be groundless, he is empowered
to discharge the accused.

6. I have carefully considered the rival contentions. There

can be no dispute with the proposition of law enunciated
in the judgments relied on by the learned Counsel wherein
it has been held that the inherent powers conferred upon
the High Court under Section 482 of the Code are wide
enough to encompass almost all situations in order to
prevent the abuse of process of any court or to otherwise
secure the ends of justice.

7.The question, however, is when and under what situation,
the High Court should step in and pass appropriate orders
in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the
Code in a criminal trial.

8.In this context it will be relevant to remind oneself of the
principles laid down by the Apex Court in the matter of
exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code. It has
been held that while exercising jurisdiction under Section
482 of the Code, the High Court would not ordinarily
embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question

is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation
 2016KERI673

Cri.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 4

of it, the accusation could be sustained. That is the
function of the trial Court. Section 482 of the Code is not
an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a
prosecution and brings about its closure without a full-
fledged enquiry. Though High Court may exercise its
power to prevent abuse of process of any Court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice, the power has be
exercised sparingly and with circumspection. The
interference must be on sound principles and the inherent
power cannot be exercised to stifle a legitimate
prosecution. It is also settled that, if on taking the
allegations and the complaint as they were, without
adding or subtracting anything, no offence was made out,
then the High Court would be justified in quashing the
proceedings in the exercise of its power under S.482
CrPC. ( See MCD v. Ram Kishan Rohtagi, 1983 (1) SCC
1; Soundaram N V P.K. Ponnuraj and Another ( 2014

(10) SCC 616 ).

Cri.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 s-

9.1 refrain from passing opinion on the merits of the
allegations at this stage lest it affect the case of either the
prosecution or the accused.

10. In the case in hand, the charge sheet has been filed
before the Court below. The procedure for trial of warrant
cases by Magistrates is provided for in Chapter XIX of the
Code. Section 238 of the Code specifically provides that at
the stage of framing of charge, it is obligatory upon the
learned Magistrate to hear the prosecution and the
accused and if the learned Magistrate considers the
Charge to be groundless, he is empowered to discharge
the accused after recording his reasons.

11.When alternate and comprehensive remedies are
available for the petitioner under the Code, this Court will
not be justified in sifting and weighing the materials in a

petition filed under Section 482 of the Code.

to approach the

learned Magistrate and advance his contentions at the
 Cri.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 6

appropriate state. I find no good reason to interfere under
Section 482 Cr.P.C.

13.In the result, this petition is disposed of with liberty to
the petitioner to seek for discharge under Section 239 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The petition is disposed off.
