6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another (2012)
10 SCC 303), the Apex Court has held that in appropriate
cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution
of disputes between the vietim and the wrongdoer to put an
end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in
Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another
(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State
of Jharkhand and Another {(2014) 9 SCC 653}

7. U have perused Annexure B affidavit filed by the 2"
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that
upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine,
and the defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I
am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public
interest 1s involved in this case, There is no impediment for
granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in
Crime No.1122 of 2023 of Narakkal Police Station, Ernakulam
are quashed.

‘This Crl.M.C is allowed as above.
