Crl.M.C. No. 7788 of 2017
Dated this the 4th day of January, 2018

ORDER

The petitioner is the accused in ST. No. 2413 of
2015 on the files of the court below. The petitioner filed
CMP No. 2891 of 2017 under Section 811 CrP.C. before
the court below praying for re-opening the evidence
issuing summons to the eight witnesses shown in the
witness list. The court below, as per Annexure -C, did
not permit the accused to examine witness Nos. 2 to 4 in
the witness list. Aggrieved by the said order, this Crl.M.C.
has been filed.

2. Heard both sides.

3. Admittedly, witness No. 2 in the witness list is
the daughter of the sister of the present complainant.
Witness No. 3 is the daughter and witness No. 4 is the
mother of the complainant in this case.
 CFLM.C. No. 7788 of 2017

4. The liability involved in this case arose out of a
contract in respect of the construction of the house of the
complainant, The complainant — contended that the
husband of the accused failed to carry on the
construction work and hence, the accused had
undertaken the liability of her husband and issued the
cheque in question. In order to prove that the
construction was already started, the petitioner wanted to
examine the above said witnesses.

5. The court below found that if the accused wanted
to prove the construction work, he could do so by
examining the workers or others who were employed for
doing the construction work. The court below further
rightly observed that for proving the construction work of
a house, the daughter and the mother of the owner of the
house are not required. The court below further observed
that the intention of the petitioner was to harass the
relatives of the complainant. Having gone through the
relevant inputs, this Court is of the view that in order to
 CHLM.C. No. 7788 of 2017

+
prove the construction of the house, the petitioner can
very well examine any of his workers. In the said
circumstances, issuing summons to witness Nos. 2 to 4 is
totally unnecessary. On the facts of the case, this Court is
of the view that — the intention of the pet

ioner in this

regard is only to cause harassment to the complainant.
Having gone through Annexure-C order, I find no reason
to hold that the said order suffers from any illegality,
impropriety or incorrectness, warranting interference by
this Court.

In this result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed.

B.SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, JUDGE.
