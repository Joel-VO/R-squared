P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.85 of 2015

Dated this the 8 day of January, 2015

ORDER

The petitioners herein are the four accused in C.C.
No.689/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1,
Kollam. Crime in the said case was registered under Sections
143, 147, 341, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, on
the complaint of one Praveen. The petitioners now seek orders
quashing the prosecution as against them on the ground that
they and the defacto complainant have amicably settled the
dispute out of court. The defacto complainant Praveen is the
second respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to
the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused,
and he has no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied
that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties,
and I find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will
not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of
the court. The petitioners seek orders under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure because composition as such is not

possible.

AMC Noss 02015 2

In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is
allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C
'No.689/2011 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I,
Kollam, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand
released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by

them will stand discharged.
