THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD OW
08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 (CRL.M.C.NO. 7456/2018 2 2020KERILAIS

ORDER
Dated this the 8th day of January 2021

This Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the entire
proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the file of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Thrissur. It is a case charge sheeted by the Town
West Police Station, Thrissur against the
petitioners and another alleging offences
punishable under Sections 506(1) and 323 r/w.
Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The offence
under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care &
Protection of Children) Act is also alleged.

2. This Crl.M.c. is filed to quash the above
proceedings mainly on the ground that, the
incident in this happened happened in connection
with a matrimonial dispute between the 1%
petitioner and the 2™ respondent. According to
the counsel for the petitioners the entire

disputes are settled as per Annexure A3 and all
 (CRL.M.C.NO. 7456/2018 3 2020KERILAIS

the cases are compromised based on Annexure A3
compromise. Now the 2% respondent is not
withdrawing the present case and hence this

Cr1.M.C. is filed to quash the proceedings.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the
petitioners and the learned counsel for the 2"
respondent also.

4, The learned counsel for the 2" respondent
submitted that, there is a counter case to
C.C.No.1124 of 2018 in which the 2° respondent
and two minor children are the accused. She and
her minor children approached this Court with an
application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash
that proceedings. But as per the order dated
16.12.2020 in Crl.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 this Court
dismissed that application. The counsel submitted
that, the 2% respondent has no objection in
quashing the proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018
if the proceedings in the counter case is also

quashed.
 (CRL.M.C.N0. 7456/2018 ‘ 2U2UKERIIS
5. The main reason for dismissing
Crl.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 was that the prayer in
that petition was to quash the F.I.R. Now it is
clear that a final report is filed in the counter
case also. If that is the case, the 2" respondent
can file a fresh petition to quash the final
report in the counter case, to which the
petitioners have no objection. Therefore,
I think, this Crl.M.C, can be disposed of with a
liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh
Crl.M.C. to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.1124
of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate  Court-II, Thrissur = once_—the
proceedings in Crime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town
West Police Station, Thrissur is quashed. The
counsel for the 2™ respondent submitted that, the
2° respondent has no objection in getting
exemption to the petitioners from the lower court
in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 if an application for

exemption is filed by the petitioners in
 (CRL.M.C.NO. 7456/2018 s 2020KERILAIS

accordance to law.

Hence, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the

following direction:

i) If an application is filed by the
petitioners for exemption in C.C.No.1124 of
2018, the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-II, Thrissur will allow the same in
accordance to law;

ii) The petitioners are given liberty
to file a fresh Crl.M.C. to quash the
proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the
file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-II, Thrissur once the proceedings in
Crime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town West

Police Station, Thrissur is quashed.
