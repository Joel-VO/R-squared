Dated this the 8” day of December, 2017

ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Annexure- private
complaint filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,
Kalpetta, which was referred to the police under Section 156
(3) CrPC., on the basis of which the police promptly
registered Annexure-II FIR for the offence under Section
420 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. The facts are very strange. The de facto
complainant in Annexure-II and the 2” petitioner herein
were the partners of a partnership firm named ‘Wayanad
Estates’. The firm has a huge extent of properties, and the
2” petitioner was the share holder of 73% of shares in the

partnership. Alleging that 1* respondent herein, who is the
 2017KERAITSE
(CxLM.C.7927/2016

de facto complainant in Annexure-II, had forged and
fabricated documents showing that the 2° petitioner has
retired from the said partnership, the 2” petitioner preferred
a complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,
Kalpetta, on the basis of which Annexure-V FIR was
registered in Crime No.422/2016 of Meppadi Police Station.
Immediately thereafter, Annexure-I complaint was preferred
by the de facto complainant in Annexure-II and got Crime
No.505/2016 registered.

3. The petitioners have produced documents to
show that the forged deed of retirement allegedly fabricated
by the 1* respondent herein was produced before the
Registrar of Firms to see that the retirement is recorded.
Notice was issued by the Registrar of Firms to the 2%
petitioner. The 2% petitioner immediately preferred
objections on the basis of which, Annexure-IIl order was
passed by the Registrar of Firms and information was

passed on to the 2” petitioner. The Registrar of Firms took
 2017KERAITSE
(CxLM.C.7927/2016

the view that there was no retirement and therefore, the
retirement was not recorded.

4. On going through Annexure-II_ as well as
Annexure-I, it seems that the allegation is that after
obtaining the entire amounts towards the share of the 2"
petitioner from the 1* respondent, she has retracted from
the transfer and by alleging falsehood, preferred the
complaint in respect of Annexure-V FIR. On the said
allegation, an offence under Section 420 IPC read with
Section 34 IPC has been incorporated in Annexure-II FIR.

5. On hearing either side, it has come out that
Annexure-1 complaint as well as Annexure-II FIR are quite
unnecessary and the same were just as a retaliatory
measure to the actions initiated by the 2 petitioner, who is
a 75 year old woman. Matters being so, all further
proceedings in Crime No.505/2016 based on Annexure-Il
and Annexure-I are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-I
 2017KERAITSE
(CxLM.C.7927/2016

complaint and Annexure-ll FIR in Crime No.505/2016 of
Meppadi Police Station and all further proceedings as

against the petitioners in it, are quashed.
