CrILM.C.No.2479 of 2015

Dated this the 17" day of April, 2015
ORDER

The petitioners are counter petitioners No.l and 3 in

M.C.No.355/2014, proceedings initiated by the Sub Divisional
Magistrate under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As
per Annexure A order, the Sub Divisional Magistrate has directed the
petitioners to appear before the Court and to show cause why they
should not be directed to execute a bond for %20,000/- with two
solvent sureties each for the like amount for keeping peace in the
locality for a period of one year. The order has been passed for the
reason that, the petitioners have been arrayed as accused in Crime
Nos.1002/2014 and 1188/2014 of Kazhakkoottam Police Station.

2. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners,
‘Annexure A order is unsustainable for the reason that, the same
does not disclose the substance of the information received by the

Sub Di

nal Magistrate. It is contended that, it is necessary to
disclose the substance of such information, in accordance with the
mandate of Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The
counsel also places reliance on the decisions of this Court in Henry
Vijayakumar v. State of Kerala [2009 (4) KLT 495] and Girish
P. and Others v. State of Kerala and Another [2009 (4) KHC

929] in support of his contention. The learned Public Prosecutor
 201SKERI7IS6

CH1.M.C.No.2479 of 2015

appears for the respondent.

3. Heard. A perusal of Annexure A order does not disclose the
substance of the information received. The order merely says that,
the SHO has submitted a copy of FIR and records in Crime

Nos.1002/2014 and 1188/2014 of Kazhakkoottam Police St

ion and
that, on a perusal of the report and the records, the Sub Divisional
Magistrate is satisfied that the petitioners are likely to indulge in
further acts of criminal activities involving breach of peace. This
Court has in paragraph 5 of the decision reported in 2009 (4) KHC
929, considered a similar order and has held as follows :

“5, $.107 of Code of Criminal Procedure enables an
executive Magistrate on receiving information that a person
is likely to commit breach of peace or disturb the public
tranquillity or to do any wrongful act that may probably
occasion a breach of the peace or disturb the public
tranquillity and is of opinion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding, to require such person to show cause why he
should not be ordered to execute a bond with or without
sureties for keeping peace for such period not exceeding
one year as the Magistrate thinks fit. S.111 mandates that
when a Magistrate acting under S.107, deems it necessary
to require any person to show cause, he shall make an order
jn writing setting forth the substance of the information
received, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term
{for which it is to be in force, and the number, character and
class of sureties, if any required, the necessity to setforth
‘the substance of the information’ in the order under $.111 is
‘not an empty formality and is with a purpose. It is to enable
the person against whom the order is passed, to appear and
 201SKERI7IS6

CH1.M.C.No.2479 of 2015
3

show cause before the Magistrate that the allegations are
not correct. Unless that information is furnished to the
‘person against whom the order is passed, he cannot defend
the allegation as against him.”

4, Since the substance of the information received has not
been disclosed in Annexure A order, the same is unsustainable.
Therefore, the petitioners are entitled to succeed

This Cri.M.C is accordingly allowed. Annexure A is quashed. It
is made clear that. the Sub Divisional Magistrate shall be at liberty

circumstances still

to pass fresh orders, in accordance with law,

warrant the issue of any such order.
