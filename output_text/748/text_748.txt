‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 Cel.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 20191KERII27

ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure (‘the Code” for brevity).

2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C. No.794 of 2018
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Perinthalmanna. In the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having
committed offence punishable under Section 509 of the IPC and

Section 120(0) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011.

3. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner
disseminated false accusations against one Selvakumar, who is his
superior officer, and when the same was questioned by the de facto

complainant, she was abused.

4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, the 2 respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is
submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been
amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavit filed by the 2

respondent to buttress

submission. It is urged that the dispute is
 Cel.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 20191KERII27
3
purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or

tranquility.

5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted
that the statement of the 2” respondent has been recorded and she

has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.

6. have considered the submissions advanced.

7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]
and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the
‘Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court
can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the

victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.

8. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to
be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.
It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious
impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on
account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends
of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be

nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak.
 CrL.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 201KERIAT

4
Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the
considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its
extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the

proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed, Annexure-A1 FIR
‘and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now
pending as C.C. No. 794/2018 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First

Class-I, Perinthalmanna are quashed.
