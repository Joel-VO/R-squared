ORDER

The petitioner is the sole accused in S.C.No.910 of
2018 on the files of the Additional District and Sessions Court
(POCSO), Kozhikode. The petitioner was arrested during the
investigation of the case and he was released on bail on
27.05.2018, It is stated that he did not receive the summons
issued by the trial court thereafter as he was abroad on
employment and consequently, he could not appear before the
trial court. It is also stated that in the circumstances, the court
has issued warrant of arrest against the petitioner. The petitioner
is prepared to surrender before the court below for facing the
trial, but he apprehends that if he surrenders, he will be
remanded to custody on the premise that he is a person who has
evaded the summons. The petitioner, therefore, seeks
appropriate directions to the court below to recall the warrant of
arrest issued against him and enlarge him on bail on his

appearance.
 2020/KERI28

cEL.M.C.No.189 of 2020

2. Should the warrant of arrest issued against the
petitioner be recalled and should he be released on bail are
matters for the trial court to consider. There is absolutely no
reason for me to think that if the petitioner surrenders before the
court below and offers satisfactory explanation for the non-
appearance, the learned trial judge would mechanically remand
him to custody, without considering his application for bail.
Nevertheless, having regard to the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the petitioner and having regard to the orders
passed by this court in similar and identical matters, | am of the
view that the Cri.M.C. can be disposed of with a direction to the
court below that if the petitioner surrenders before the court and
applies for recalling the warrant and for bail, the same shall be
considered and disposed of by the court below on the same day

itself, with notice to the Public Prosecutor. Ordered accordingly.
