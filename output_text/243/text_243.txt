BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C. No.575 of 2024

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner challenges Annexure-B FIR in Crime No.4 of
2024 of Kongad Police Station. The offence alleged against the

petitioner is under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

2. According to the FIR, the petitioner had collected an
amount of Rs.11 lakhs from the complainant by offering to
arrange a visa for his brother for Dubai and thereafter, failed to
arrange the visa or return the amount and thereby, committed

the offence alleged,

3. Sri, Mansoor B.H., the learned counsel for the
petitioner contended that, the entire allegations raised by the
defacto complainant are false and that, he had even
suppressed material facts as well. It was pointed out that,
Annexure-D is an enquiry report submitted on the very same
set off facts, wherein the Inspector of Kongad Police Station
conducted an enquiry and concluded that, there were doubts

regarding the veracity of the complaint. According to the
 2024KERA2O6
CRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024

learned counsel, the said enquiry report is sufficient to

disprove the allegations in the FIR.

4. Sri, Noushad KA, learned Public Prosecutor
opposed the contentions and submitted that, the investigation
is only at the initial stages and it is too premature to interfere,

under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

5. | have considered the contentions advanced by the

petitioner. The allegations in the FIR relates to an alleged
cheating, committed by the petitioner for failure to arrange a
visa after collecting Rs.11 lakhs. On a perusal of Annexure-D, it
is noticed that, an enquiry was conducted on the very same set
off allegations by the Inspector of Kongad Police Station and
concluded that, there were doubts regarding the veracity of the
complaint. However, merely because, such an enquiry was
conducted on the very same set off allegations raised by the
complainant, the same cannot be a reason to interfere with
the investigation now conducted. The said enquiry report can
of course be taken into reckoning by the Investigating Officer
during the investigation based on the present FIR. Every FIR

registered must culminate in a final report, after due

investigation. Therefore, the said natural process of
 224KERIA266
CRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024

investigation cannot be scuttled by invoking the jurisdiction
under Section 482 of CrP.C. unless there are exceptional
circumstances. It is for the Investigating Officer to arrive at a
conclusion by considering the entire circumstances arising in
the instant case including Annexure-D. Therefore, Section 482

of Cr.P.C cannot be invoked at this stage of the investigation.

With the above observations this Criminal M.C. is

dismissed.
