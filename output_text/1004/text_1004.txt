3 If the accused is found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?

9. Boint No.1 & 2: PW1 deposed before the court that the accused is the hus-
band of PW1, She did not know about the details of the case. Hence PW1

10. PW2 deposed before the court that the incident occurred in the year 2013
while he had been working as Assistant Manager in account section of Marikar

Motors, Thiruvananthapuram. On 10.10.2013 their caused some interruption
to the online transaction of Marikar motors with the SBT, Secretariat branch,
(on inquired about it it is revealed that someone reduced the merchant unit in

‘money transaction with SBI. The issue was resolved on the same day but on
the next day (11.10.2013) the account of Marikar Motors was locked and the
customers could not make payment to Marikar Motors. The customers of
Marikar motors made complaint against it in the show room. A complaint was
filed on this incident to the police. This was done by someone who entered into
the unique identification system of the computer downloaded it
 5

‘unauthorisingly and committed this thing. Based on the complaint the police
identified the accused by tracing his IP address.

11. PW3 deposed before the court that while he had been working as Civil Police
Officer of City Cyber Cell the statement of PW1 was recorded in his presence.

12, PW4 deposed before the court that at the time of the incident he was working
as Assistant General Manager of Marikar Motors, Statue. The accused was
terminated from service of Marikar Motors as per the direction of the
‘management. There was some interruption occurred in the banking transaction
of Marikkar motors due to the modification in the password of the computer
which resulted in locking the account and this was done by someone who
reset the password and locked the account, All these things happened when the
accused was terminated from the office of Marikar Motors,
‘Thiruvananthapuram,

13, PWS deposed before the court that on 02.11.2013 while he had been working,
as Sub Inspector of Cantonment police he had registered the FIR in this case

17. Thave analyzed the evidence of PW1 to 8 and perused Ext P1 to P14 series.
On going through Ext P6 FIR it is seen that the incident occurred in between
10.10.2013 to 31.10.2013 and information received the police station on
(02.11.2013. After that the FIR was filed before this court on 04.11.2013. Itis
interesting to be noted that Ext P6 FIR registered by PWS not recorded the
reason for delay and instead of it, it is recorded as no delay. It is pertinent to
note that it is settled proposition of law that the delay in lodging the FIR and
delay in the sending of FIR before this court must be satisfied. ‘The complaint
filed by the PW1 is silent about the name of the accused. PW3 deposed before
the court during the cross examination that he had taken down the FIS
statement of the PW1, But no such FI Statement was seen found in the
prosecution records and the prosecution was no consistent version for this
matter. In this case, the allegation of the prosecution is that someone in
between the dates 10.10.2013 to 31.10.2013 unauthorisly used the computer
datas of Marikar Motors, Thiruvananthapuram and done malpractice. To the
tax returns and SBT bank accounts and thereby caused interruption to the day
to day business affairs of the Marikar Motors, Thiruvananthapuram. It is perti-
nent to note that none of the officials of SBI, Statue branch was examined by
the prosecution to strengthen the prosecution story. The prosecution bring a
bundle of documents relating to the transactions of Marikar Motors Limited.
Ext PI is the complaint, Ext P3 is the letter sent to the SBT Bank by Marikar
Motors and another one is Ext P4 which is a return statement of Kerala
Commercial Tax Department executed by the Manager, Marikar Motors.
Ext P2 is an another document sent by the accountant to the Assistant manager
of Marikar Motors dated 23.10.2013. On perusal of this letter it is seen that
the Marikar Motors admitted the mistake crept in the password of commercial
site of the said company. The letter was found to be written on 23.10.2013.
As per the version of the prosecution witnesses accused is terminated from

this office prior to 23.10.2013. So the evidence brought out by the prosecution
is not tally with the version of the prosecution that the accused unauthorisingly
 7

downloading or copying or interrupting the digital system of computer of
Marikar Motors with a dishonest intention so as to cause any interruption to
the day to day business affairs of Marikar Motors.

18. It is pertinent to note according to Section 43 of the Information Technology
‘Act which imposes liability for defined set of action performed personally
which subject t0 individual to penalties but not to criminal prosecution.
However, when these actions was carried out with guilty state of mind as a
specified by fraudulently or dishonestly in section 66 of the Information
‘Technology act they constitute an offence. By virtue of section 66, additionally
any act as defined u/s, 43 is done dishonestly and fraudulently attract section
66 of the Information Technology Act. So in order to constitute the offence of
section 66 and 66 C of the Information Technology Act someone has to done
act with dishonest or fraudulent manner and should cover the element of

deceit which is an additional concomitant for constituting act as cheating

equivalent to the definition under section 415 of Indian Penal Code. Here in
this case, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the offence of Section
66 and 66 C of Information Technology Act against the accused based on the
prosecution witnesses and documents the light of the discussions above
‘mentioned. Hence, points no. 1 and 2 are found against the prosecution.

10. Point no. 3:-In view of my findings on Points Nos.1 and 2, it is found that the
accused is found not guilty for the offences punishable under Sections 66 and
66 (c) of the Information Technology Act.

11, Inthe result, the accused is found not guilty and acquitted under section 248(1)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offences under sections 66 and
(66 (c) of the Information Technology Act. The bail bond of the accused stands
cancelled and he is set at liberty.
