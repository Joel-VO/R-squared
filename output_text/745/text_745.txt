SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Cri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018
ORDER
The petitioner stands arrayed as an accused in Crime
No.989/2011 of Chathannoor Police Station now pending as S.C.
No.139/2012 of IV Additional Sessions Court, Kollam for offences
punishable under Sections 376, 450, 506(ii) and 341 of IPC. The
crux of the allegation was that, on 06.07.2011 at 12.00 noon, the
petitioner trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant
and committed rape on her. Witnesses were examined to support

the prosecution case. In the course of inve: the

petitioner was subjected to a potency test. Annexure 7 is the
Certificate of Potency dated 09.07.2011 issued by an Assistant
Surgeon of the District Hospital, Kollam, by which the final opinion
was reserved pending the report of urological examination. It
seems that the petitioner was not subjected to a urological
‘examination in the course of investigation. After the examination
‘of CW 22, who was examined as PW 15 and after marking of
Exhibits P1 to P20, it seems that the prosecution noticed the
above and filed an application for subjecting the petitioner to a

urological examination. The court below by the impugned order
 2018KERSIS
(Cr M,C. No, 8796 of 2017 2

in Cr.M.P. No.1949/2017 allowed the application directing the
petitioner to appear before the Urologist, District Hospital, Kollam

on 18.12.2017 at 9.00 a.m. for examination by the Urologist. This
order is challenged in this proceedings. Having regard to the
nature of the relief sought, | am not inclined to issue notice to the

3 respondent, since the matter itself can be disposed of without

her presence.

2. The specific contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is that in the nature of allegation raised against him,
the potency and the capability of the petitioner herein to enter
into physical relationship is crucial. It is contended that the
potency certificate issued by the Doctor in the above
circumstance without a urological examination at that point of
time, is a very valuable defence which has accrued to him, due to
the lapse of time and the laches on the part of the prosecution
and the consequent lacuna cannot be filled up at this length of
time by directing the petitioner to undergo a urological
examination. It was further contended that the petitioner had
certain physiological defects affecting his potency at the time of

investigation and that he was taking medicines for that. Further
 201SKERSIS
(Cr M,C. No, 8796 of 2017 3

contention advanced at the time of hearing is that, even if he has
gained physical ability now, that cannot relate back to the date of
original examination of him on 09.07.2011.

3. Definitely, this is a valuable defence available to the
petitioner. However, having regard to the fact that even if the
petitioner undergoes urological examination, the court below will
have to appreciate the validity of that document specifically
having regard to the delay that has occurred in undergoing the
urological test and also the question whether the report given at a
subsequent stage can relate back to the actual physical capacity
as on the date of incident, are matters to be specifically
considered by the court below, while appreciating evidence.
Reserving this right, | am inclined to dispose of the Cri.M.C. with a
direction that the petitioner shall appear before the court below
on the next posting date, on which day, the court shall fix a date
for appearance of the petitioner for urological examination.
Thereafter, the court may proceed in accordance with law and
while appreciating the evidence, the court shall take note of the
observations made above.

4. The warrant issued by the court below in the above
 ao1wKERSIY
CC. M.C. No, 8796 of 2017, 4

circumstance, will be kept in abeyance till the date of his
appearance before the court below on the next posting date, on
which day, the court below shall consider his application for
withdrawal of the warrant, considering the fact that he had
approached this Court challenging the impugned order.

Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.
