Station for the offences punishable under Sections 341,
323, 324, 506(i) and 355 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably
settled between the petitioners and the de facto
complainant, who is the 2” respondent herein.

3. The 2% respondent has filed Annexure-A3
affidavit affirming that the matter has been amicably settled
between him and the petitioners and presently, he has no
complaints against the petitioners. When the matter is
settled between the parties, no purpose would be served in

proceeding with the matter further. Matters being so, all
