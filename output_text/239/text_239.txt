BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.524 of 2024

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024

ORDER

The limited relief now sought for by the petitioner is for a direction
to extend the time to deposit an amount of Rs.34,500/- stipulated as a
condition for suspending the sentence. Though petitioner has already
been granted three months, which is the statutorily fixed period, I am of
the view that as a last chance, a further 30 days from today can be
granted,

Accordingly, the time to deposit the amount stipulated in
Annexure-A2 order shall stand extended by a further period of 30 days
from today.

The Cri.M.

disposed of as above.
