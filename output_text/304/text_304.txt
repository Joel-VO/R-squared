ORDER

These applications are filed by all the
accused/ defacto complainant jointly to quash the
proceedings in C.C.No.1077/2006, C.C.No.1076/2006 and
C.C.No.1075/2006 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod, on the basis of settlement
under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

2. It is alleged in the petitions that, the first
petitioner is the managing partner of the firm Mount
Crescent Construction, of which second petitioner was an
employee. During the period from 1986-1996, certain
malpractices were committed by the second petitioner and
an amount of %84,227/- was misappropriated. So the first
petitioner filed a complaint on the basis of which Crime
No.455/1999 was registered and after investigation three
separate charge-sheets were filed on the basis of which the

cases have been taken on file as C.C.No.1077/2006,
 awisweRa7ay9
Ca, MLC. Nos. 2406, 2451 and 2435 02015

1076/2006 and 1075/2006 on the file of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod. Now the matter has
been settled between the parties and the entire amount due
has been paid as per the agreement. Since the entire
amount has been paid and it is only a monitory dispute
arose between the employee and the employer, the first
petitioner does not want to prosecute the second petitioner.
Since some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature,
they cannot file application before the court below. So the
petitioners have filed the above petitions for quashing the
proceedings.

3. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that,
except these cases, there is no other case against the
second petitioner and it was a business relationship
between the parties in which certain amounts have been
misappropriated by the second petitioner. Since more than
three offences have been committed, within a span of more
than one year, three separate charge-sheet have been filed

and these cases have been taken on file.
 awisweRa7ay9
Ca, MLC. Nos. 2406, 2451 and 2435 02015

4. Heard the counsel for the petitioners as well.

5. It is an admitted fact that first petitioner is
the partner of the firm Mount Crescent Construction and
second petitioner was working as employee under them. He
was working there from 1986-1996. Later it was revealed
that, second petitioner had committed some
misappropriation to the tune of %84,227/- during this period.
When this was found out, on the basis of the complaint
given by the first petitioner, Crime No.455/1999 was
registered and after investigation three separate charge-
sheets were filed against the second petitioner and on the
basis of which three cases have been taken on file as
C.C,No.1077/2006, 1076/2006 and 1075/2006 respectively
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Kasaragod. It is seen from Annexure-III agreement that,
the matter has been settled between the parties and the
entire amount due has been paid as well and this settlement
was arrived at due to the intervention of well-wishers of

both the parties. In view of the settlement, first petitioner
 awisweRa7ay9
Ca, MLC. Nos. 2406, 2451 and 2435 02015
had agreed to withdraw the prosecution and it is on the
basis of which these petitions have been filed. Though
certain offences are non- compoundable in nature, there is
no evidence to show that any forgery has been committed
or any manipulation of accounts has been committed. But
certain amounts entrusted while he was working under the
first petitioner were seen misappropriated by the second
petitioner, which he later admitted and paid in the
mediation held between the parties due to the intervention
of well-wishers of both parties. Since the matter has been
settled between the parties and both the defacto-
complainant/ accused have jointly filed this petition for
quashing the proceedings, no purpose will be served by
proceeding the case as well, as they are not going to
support the case of the prosecution.

6. Further in the decision reported in Gian
Singh v. State of Panjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that, in cases where

personal disputes and matrimonial disputes, or monitory
 awisweRa7ay9
Co, MLC. Nos. 2406, 2451 and 2435 02015

dispute of criminal nature resulted in registration of crime

and the matter has been settled between the parties, even
though certain non-compoundable offence has been
incorporated in order to honour the settlement, court must
invoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure to quash the proceedings.

7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above
decision, and also considering the fact that it is a dispute
between the employer and employee and relating to
monitory dispute between them, which has been settled due
to the intervention of mediators and the entire amount said
to have been misappropriated has been paid and other
offences namely, offence under Section 465, 468 and 477A
have not been made even on the basis of evidence, this
court feels that, there is no purpose in proceeding the case,
as the possibility of conviction is remote and proceeding the
cases will only amount to wastage of judicial time. So this
court feels that, it is a fit case where the power under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be
 awisweRa7ay9
Ca, MLC. Nos. 2406, 2451 and 2435 02015

invoked to quash the proceedings, so as to honour the
settlement entered into between the parties and also to
promote the relationship that has been restored between

the parties on account of the settlement. The pendency of

this case should not be a hurdle for the same.

So the applications are allowed and further
proceedings in C.C.No.1077/2006, C.C.No.1076/2006 and
C.C,No.1075/2006 (arising out of Crime No.455/1999 of
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod) pending
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Kasaragod, as against the second petitioner are quashed.

Office is directed to communicate this order to the

concerned court, immediately.
