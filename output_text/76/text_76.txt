Crl.M.C. No. 70 of 2014

Dated this the 02" day of January, 2014

ORDER

This is a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
seeking to have all further proceedings in C.C. 1977 of 2013
pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l,
Kasaragod, which arose out of Crime No. 147 of 2013 of
Kumbala Police Station quashed.

2. The petitioner stands accused of having
committed the offences punishable under Sections 342 and
324 of IPC.

3, It is unnecessary to go into the facts and details of
the case for the simple reason that the petitioner has
impleaded the defacto complaint/victim as the first
respondent who has entered appearance through a counsel
and the learned counsel appearing for the second
respondent has accepted that the affidavit filed along with

this petition is one sworn to by the first respondent herself

Crl.M.C. No.70/2014
2

and she stands by the statements contained therein.

4. On going through the said affidavit, it is seen that
the parties have settled all their differences and issues
between them and no further grievance remains to be
redressed. It is also pointed out in the affidavit that the
defacto complainant is not interested in prosecuting the
matter further.

5. In the light of the stand taken by the defacto
complainant, it is felt that continuance of the proceedings
will only be an exercise in futility.

Hence, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings
in C.C. 1977 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Kasaragod including the final report
based on which cognizance was taken shall stand quashed
and the petitioner shall stand discharged.
