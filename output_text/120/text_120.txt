Crl.M.C. No.103 of 2024

Dated this the 22” day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482
CrP.C to quash all proceedings against them.

2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 9 in C.C.No.317/2020 on the
files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-Il, Kasaragod,
arising out of Crime No.438/2019 of Badiadkka Police Station
registered for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,
148, and 427 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
‘The 2~ respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, accused formed themselves into
an unlawful assembly, protested against the Citizenship
Amendment Act, and pelted stones on the car of the de facto
complainant, causing damage to it, and thereby committed the

offences alleged.

4, Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned
 2024KERISI70

counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public
Prosecutor.

. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the
matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the
petitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,
considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be
served by continuing the proceedings.

. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another ((2012) 10 SCC
303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes
between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the
criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder
‘Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another ((2014) 6 SCC
466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand
and Another (2014) 9 SCC 653].

1 have perused Annexure-Alll affidavit filed by the 2“
respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that
upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine,

and the de facto complainant stands by the contents thereof. 1
 2024KERISI70

am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public
interest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for
granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

. Though the learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that accused

3 to 6, 8 and 10 have criminal antecedents against them, 1 am

of the view that considering the nature of the settlement

arrived at between the parties, no purpose would be achieved

in continuing the prosecution.

Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in

C.C.No.317/2020 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-Il, Kasaragod, are quashed.

‘This Cel.M.C is allowed as above.
