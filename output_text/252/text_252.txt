Crl.M.C. No.720 of 2024

Dated this the 23" day of January, 2024
ORDER,

Pe

joner is the first accused in $.C.No.1205/2020 on the
files of the Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)-Il, Kollam; for
the offences punishable under Sections 120(b), 143, 144, 148,
449, 204(b), S06Gi), 341, 323, 324 & 302 s/w Section 149 of
the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Subsequently, petitioner was
implicated as an accused in Crime No, 1712/2023 of Kollam

joner has been

East Police Station. On 19.01.2024, pk
granted interim bail for the subsequent crime.

While the proceedings in $.C.No.1205/2020 were going on
before the Sessions Court, and due to the registration of the
second crime, petitioner failed to appear before the trial
court, apprehending his arrest. Due to his failure to appear
before the Sessions Court, a non bailable warrant has been

issued against him. Though peti

eras represented

through his Counsel, who had even sought for condonation

of his absence, the learned Sessions Judge issued a non

bailable warrant against the petitioner, which is challenged in

this petition under Section 482 of Cr.
Sri.M.Rajesh, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted
that petitioner has been granted interim bail on 19.01.2024 in
B.A.No,10827/2023; and therefore the apprehension of arrest
in the subsequent crime does not subsist. However, since a
non bailable warrant has been issued against him, petitioner
apprehends that he may be remanded to custody on his

appearance before the Sessions Court. It is further submitted

that petitioner is willing to cooperate with the trial without
fail.

‘SmtSreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the
application and submitted that petitioner is involved in a
serious crime and that he has involved himself in a

subsequent crime as well as, and therefore, this Court ought

tion in

not to issue any direction to consider the bail appli

a time bound manner.

5. I have considered the rival contentions.
6. It was evident from Annexure-3 that, though the petitioner
was directed to appear before the Court on 12.12.2023 and
he had appeared through counsel, the Sessions Court had
rejected the application for condonation of his absence and
issued a non bailable warrant after cancellation of the bail
bond. True that petitioner apprehended arrest in the second
crime. However, that is not a reason to avoid appearing in
court when there was a direction to appear. Considering the
circumstances of the case, the omission to appear on the
posting date despite a direction by the said Court is a

serious omis

ion. However, since petitioner has now offered
to appear before the court and participate in the proceedings
without fail, I am of the view that circumstances warrant the
issuance of a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to
consider the application for recall of warrant and for bail, if
any, filed by the petitioner, on the same day itself.

7. Accordingly, if the petitioner prefers any application for

recall of warrant and for grant of bail on or before
 2024KERISI66

02.02.2024, the learned Sessions Judge shall consider the
same on the same day itself and pass appropriate orders.
‘The Crl.M.C.is disposed of.
