THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON

 224KERIA67

Crl.M.C.No.550 of 2024

Dated this the 18° day of January, 2024
ORDER
Petitioner seeks to quash the prosecution initiated against him,
by invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

. Petitioner is the first accused in C.C.No.177/2021 on the files of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, arising out
of Crime No.315/2019 of Cherupuzha Police Station, Kannur
District. Petitioner is being prosecuted for the offences
punishable under Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860.

. According to the prosecution, the accused had collected more

than Rs.60,00,000/- from the de facto complainant and other

persons, promising to provide employment in a Five Star Hotel
at Malta and thereafter failed to provide the employment and

return the amount, thereby committing the offences alleged.

|. The learned counsel submitted that petitioner has absolutely

no involvement in the alleged crime and that he is totally

innocent of the allegations. It was further submitted that
petitioner has been falsely roped into the crime on the mere
allegation that he had directed the de facto complainant to
hand over money to the 2" accused. It was submitted that,
the said allegation was false, and there is no proof of any
nature, It was further submitted that the agreement produced
herein as Annexure-A4 reveals that the transaction was solely
between the de facto complainant, and the 2"! accused and the
petitioner had no connection whatsoever.

T have heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who submitted that
the allegations by itself indicate the commission of offences
alleged and therefore the jurisdiction under Section 482 of

cr

“cannot be invoked. It was further submitted that, from
the contentions advanced itself it was evident that the
allegations in the final report, if admitted, would satisfy the

igredients of the offences alleged.

T have considered the rival contentions.
Petitioner is alleged to have directed the de facto complainant

and other persons to pay Rs.60,00,000/- to the 2™ accused to
 224KERIA67

enable them to obtain employment in a Five Star Hotel at
Malta. It was contended that there was no such direction and
that petitioner had no connection at all with the de facto
complainant. Though allegedly the 2" accused had issued
cheques in purported return of the amounts paid by the
complainant, and proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act has already been initiated by the de facto
complainant against the 2 accused, I am of the view that
those are all matters that can be considered only after trial or
at least through a discharge petition,

Jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is exceptional in
nature and can be invoked only when the admitted allegations
do not make out any offence or that the proceedings are
initiated with mala fides, as held in the decision in State of
Haryana_and others v. Bhajan Lal and others (1992) Suppl. 1
SCC 335.

on a perusal of the nature of allegations, it cannot be held that
the admitted allegations would not constitute the offence

alleged against the petitioner. Therefore, Section 482 of
 224KERIA67

cr

the

"- cannot be invoked by the petitioner. However,
circumstances enable the filing of a discharge petition, it is
open for the petitioner to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate
with such a relief.

In that view of the matter, this Crl.M.

is dismissed.
