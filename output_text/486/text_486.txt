CRL.M.C. No. 5516 of 2014

“Dated this the 9” day of January, 2018

ORDER

The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.974/2014 of
the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,
Thiruvananthapuram, which has arisen from Annexure-II
final report in Crime No.768/2014 of the Karamana Police
Station, Thiruvananthapuram, for the offence punishable
under Section 117(e) of the Kerala Police Act. It is alleged
that the petitioner had obstructed the removal of an aged
woman, who was abandoned on the road, to the police
station for taking her to some old age home.

2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that on information that the aged woman was abandoned by

somebody on the road, the police reached there and they
 CRLM.C.No. $516 of 2014

wanted to somehow wash their hands and to send the aged
woman to the premises of the Attukal Bagavathi Temple,
The petitioner questioned the same and called media
persons thereby the police was constrained to remove the
aged woman to an old age home.

3. On a perusal of the report appended with
Annexure 1 FIR it seems that an offence under Section
117(e) of the Kerala Police Act had not taken place. Apart
from questioning the attempt of the police to send the aged
woman to some other place in order to wash their hands,
nothing had happened. The police got irritated when media
persons appeared at the spot. The prosecution of the
petitioner in this matter is quite unnecessary and therefore,
Annexure II final report and all further proceedings pursuant
to it in C.C.No.974/2014 pending before the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thiruvananthapuram in Crime
No.768/2014 of the Karamana Police Station,

Thiruvananthapuram, are liable to be quashed
 CRLM.C.No. $516 of 2014

In the result, this Cr.M.C. is allowed and Annexure II
final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in
C.C.No.974/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-I, Thiruvananthapuram in Crime
No.768/2014 of the Karamana Police _ Station,

Thiruvananthapuram, are hereby quashed.
