SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.4149 of 2016
Dated this the 3° day of August, 2016
ORDER
Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.462 of 2015,
of Viyoor Police Station for offences punishable under sections
341, 294(b) and 324 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 09.04.2015
while the de facto complainant was proceeding on a scooter along
with his wife, accused waylaid him, took out his helmet and hit on
his body. Wife also allegedly suffered some injury. On the basis of
the complaint laid, crime was registered and the matter is being
investigated. While so, parties have resolved their disputes and all
terms and conditions between the parties in relation to the
settlement has been narrowed down in the form of Annexure-A3
agreement. Pursuant to that, an affidavit has been filed by the de
facto complainant as Annexure-A2.

3. Both counsel submitted that, though there is an
allegation in the FIS that the wife had also sustained injury, in
fact, she did not go to the hospital nor did the police take her

statement. Neither party has got a case now that the wife was

also injured. Having regard to this, I am satisfied that the parties
have resolved their disputes evidenced by Annexures-A2 and A3.
Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the
petitioner is not involved in any other case. Having regard to
these facts, I am inclined to take a lenient view and to grant the
relief sought for.

In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. Entire proceedings

arising from Crime No.462 of 2015 of Viyoor Police Station stand

quashed.
