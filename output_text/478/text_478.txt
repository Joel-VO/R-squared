matter has been amicably settled and they have no
existing grievance whatsoever = against ~—the
petitioners. A report has been filed by the
investigating officer through the Senior Public
Prosecutor to that effect. The petitioners do not
have any criminal antecedents. Even though the
offence under Section 308 of I.P.C. is incorporated,
the injuries are not life-threatening. No public
public interest is involved.

In the result, the Crl.M.Cs. are allowed and the
entire proceedings as against the petitioners in
Crime No.290/2015 of Valayam Police Station, now
pending as L.P.No.18/2019, S.C.Nos.733/2018 and 480/2019
