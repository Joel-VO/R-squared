SUNIL THOMAS, J.
Cr1.M.C.No.6995 of 2017

Dated this the 7* day of December, 2017

ORDER

‘The second accused in CC No. 1599/2017 pending before the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -III, Punalur for offences
punishable under sections 56(A) and (b) of Abkari Act, aggrieved
by the order of the Learned Magistrate in CMP No. 2877/2017
refusing to lift the attachment of his property, has approached this
Court challenging that order.

2. The petitioner herein along with the mother were arrayed
as accused on an allegation that, on 18/10/2011, the accused were
found in possession of Arishtam and Asavam and thereby they
committed offences punishable under the Kerala Abkari Act After
investigation, final report was laid. Since the petitioner herein was
not available, non bailable warrant was issued and steps under
sections 82 and 83 of the Cr.P.C.were ordered. The properties,
having an extent of 37.03 Ares in Re.Sy No.170/2/7 and 144/1/15
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 2

of Piravanthoor village, were attached by order of the Magistrate.
Pending the proceedings, the first accused died and the charge
against her abated. The petitioner herein surrendered in 2017 and
was released on bail. Thereafter, he filed CMP No.2877/2017
before the Magistrate praying to lift the attachment of the
property, The above application was dismissed by the learned
Magistrate holding that the application was filed after a lapse of 8
years from the date of the attachment and in view of Section 85(3)

cri

the property vested with the Government and the accused
cannot, after expiry of two years from the date of the attachment of
the property, request to lift the attachment and to release the
property. It was held that, the remedy available to the accused
for lifting the attachment was to make a request to Government to
release the property. The petitioner has to file an application
before the District Collector for lifting the attachment, since the
property vested with the Government, it was held. Aggrieved by
the above order, the 2" accused has preferred this Crl.M.C,

3. Heard both sides and examined the records.

4. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner
herein is that, under section 85 of Cr.P.C., the moment the accused
surrenders before the Court, and is released on bail, the
attachment stands lifted. Once the person, against whom the
proclamation was issued and whose property was attached,

surrenders before the Court and standing warrants are cancelled,
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 3

he is no longer absconding and the purpose of attachment of the
property comes to an end.

5. To substantiate the above contention, learned counsel for
the petitioner relied on the decisions reported in Vimlaben
Ajitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel and others
(2008) 4 SCC 649), and also the decision of this Court in Abdul
Khadar v. State of Kerala (2015 (5) KHC 351) . On the other
hand, learned Public Prosecutor, supporting the impugned order
relied on the decision of this Court in Moideen v. S..Police and
another (2010 (3) ILR 796), to contend that the right of the
petitioner to get the property released from the attachment had
ceased to operate in the light of the time limit prescribed under

section 85 of the Act.

6. A perusal of Section 83 Cr-P.C.indicates that it enables the
court to order attachment of the property of a person absconding.
Section 84 Cr.P.C. deals with the claims and objections to
attachment to be preferred by any person other than the
proclaimed person, Section 85(1) Cr.P.C.Provides that, if the
proclaimed person appears within the time limit specified in the
proclamation, the court shall make an order releasing the property
from the attachment. Section 85 (2) provides that if proclaimed
person does not appear within the time specified in the

proclamation, the property under the attachment shall be at the
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 4

disposal of the State Government. It is prescribed that the property
shall not sold until the expiry of six months from the date of the
attachment and until claim preferred or objection made therein
under section 84 has been disposed of.

7. However, under section 85 (3) of Cr.P.C., if within two
years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property
is or has been at the disposal of the State Government voluntarily
or is apprehended and brought before the court and it is proved
that he did not abscond or conceal himself for the purpose of
avoiding execution of the warrant, the property shall be released to
him and if the property has already been sold, the net proceeds of
the sale or, the residue of the sale proceeds, as the case may be, as
available shall be returned.

9. Evidently, statute provides for a self contained procedure
for attachment and disposal. The underlying object is to ensure the
appearance of the accused and not merely to sell the property.
Interpreting Section 85 (3) Cr-P.C., this court in Moideen v.
S.L.of Police and another (supra), had held that under section 85
(3) CrP.C if a person appears within the time limit, he should
satisfy the twin conditions mentioned therein. If the said period is
over, the absconding accused is not entitled to file an application to
get the property released under sub section (3) of section 85
CrP.

9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mrs. V.G.Peterson v.
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 s

O.V.Forbes and Another (1963 KHC 640) in a proceeding
under the contempt of court Act held that essential purpose of
keeping the property under attachment was to secure the presence
of the persons against whom action is proposed to be taken. In
Vimlaben's case , the Supreme Court held that provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure do not warrant sale of the property
despite the fact that the absconding accused had surrendered and
obtained bail. Once he surrenders before the court and the
standing warrants are cancelled, he is no longer an absconder. The
purpose of attaching the property comes to an end. This view was
reiterated by a Single Judge of this court in Abdul Khadar v.
State of Kerala (2015 (5) KHC 361) , wherein it was held that,
on surrender of the accused within two years and the warrant is
recalled, it has to be deemed that the court below was satisfied
that the accused did not abscond on his own and the satisfaction is
sufficient to automatically release the property from attachment.
10. It seems that in the present case the accused had
appeared after two years and was released on bail. However, the
question arise is whether the court can order the return of the
property after two years. It seems that, this question was directly
answered by a Single Bench of this Court in Babu v. State of
Kerala (2011 (3) KLT 3838). It was specifically held in that
decision that after the expiry of the two years since the attached

property is at the disposal of the Government, it is open to the
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 6

petitioner to request the Government to release the property if it is,
not already sold and the residue, in case any portion is sold or the
sale proceeds if it is sold completely. It appears that the above
decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the case.

11. In the light of the decision in Abdul Khadar v. State of
Kerala (supra), essentially it has to be held that pursuant to the
release of the accused on bail, his attachment stands vacated,
Hence, the question regarding the release of the property, now lies
within the domain of the government . Necessarily, the petitioner
has to move the concerned authority with appropriate application,
However, since attachment is ordered by the Court, formal order of
withdrawing the attachment has to be passed by the court, Hence,
while disagreeing with the finding of the court below that the
accused, to lift the attachment, has to request the Government, I
am inclined to hold that, in the light of the decision in Abdul
Khadar v. State of Kerala (supra), it has to be presumed that
purpose of attachment stands full filed. Hence, learned Magistrate
ought to have ordered withdrawal of attachment. ‘The further
remedy of the petitioner herein is to move the District Collector for
releasing the property, if in the meanwhile, it has not been sold.

12. Hence, Cr.M.C.is allowed in part. Attachment is deemed
as withdrawn. The petitioner shall file appropriate application
before the District Collector to release the property. If such

application is filed, The District Collector shall pass appropriate
 2017KERUISSS
CHLM,C.No 6995/2017 7

orders within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the
application treating the attachment as lifted

Crl.M.C.is allowed in part accordingly.
