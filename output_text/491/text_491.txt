ORDER
Dated this the 4th day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused Nos.1, 2 and 3
in Crime No.550/2016 registered at the
Varappuzha Police Station, Ernakulam for
offences punishable under Sections 323,
294(b), 448, 506 (1) read with Section 34 of
IPC, now pending as C.C.No.510/2016 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court-III, North Paravur. The de facto
complainant, at whose instance the crime was

registered, is arrayed as the 3" respondent.

Annexure-A3 affidavit has been filed by 3°
respondent stating that the dispute, which
was the reason for the incident and
registration of the crime, has been resolved
amicably and he has no subsisting grievance

against the petitioners.
 (caL.M.c.No.5586 OF 2020 2020/KERIIO7

a

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor
also, who, on instructions, submits that the
petitioners have no criminal antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the
offences alleged, nature of the injury
caused and having perused the affidavit
filed by the 3° respondent, the contents of
which are submitted to be true and
voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute
is settled and no public interest is
involved in this matter. Moreover, in view
of the settlement, possibility of the
criminal proceedings ending in conviction is
remote. As such, continuance of the
proceedings will amount to an abuse of
process of court and hence, in view of the
legal position set out by the Honourable
Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State
of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582) and Gian Singh

v. State of Punjab and another ((2012) 10
 2nnuKERINO?

SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting
the relief sought.

In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed.
The proceedings in C.C.No.510/2016 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-III, North Paravur is quashed.
