PW30,PW32 toPW39, PW43 to PW109,PW110 to PW130,PW132 to

 120623
41.PW18 in his examination in chief stated that the accused no.1 and 2 did the

business ,but in his cross examination he stated that the accused no.2 had no

connection with the said bank

42. PW25 in his cross examination denied the statement before the police He
identified accused no.2 who is standing in the dock as accused no.1

Sahrafudeen .

43, PW 31 Sobhana in the cross examination stated that the chitty business was run
by Sharahudeen who is standing in the dock,whereas the accused no.2 was
present .According to her she gave a written complaint to the police which was

by the accused nol and his brother in the cross examination he stated that the

accused no.1 has two brothers and he has no knowledge about them .

44,PW104 states that he has no knowledge about the persons who did the business

45, Now lets examine whether prosecution has proved the offence w/s.420 of IPC
as committed by the accused no.2 or not.In order to prove the said offence first

of all the prosecution has to prove that the accused no.2 had with dishonest
 130023
intention induced its customers to deliver the money and thereafter taken the

‘money .the ingredients of the $.420 IPC states as follows :

For an offence under $.420, IPC, the following ingredients must be presen
Cheating as defined under S.415, IPC, that is, there should be a fraudulent or

dishonest inducement of a person;
ii, An intention to deceive; and

ili. The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to
a. Deliver property to any person; or

b. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and

capable of being converted into valuable security.

46, While analysing the oral evidence of witnesses ,it can be seen that there is no
direct evidence which shows that accused no.2 had run the chitty business and
the bank and collected money .The oral evidence confined to the accused no.1

and not accused no.2 .Though PW163 states that accused no. and 2 were

running the business ,he in the examination in chief it self stated that he has not

complained to any authorities LHe denied his statement before the police .when

he was asked about the role of accused no,2 in the cross examination he
responded that ‘ 19200 amon} amrgomna Qisl3 alatanm qo ais)

cargan1 am mumwqyatey@ ) anotexty (A). According to him he posses no

documents pertaining to the alleged transaction .The evidence of him when

analysed with other evidence cannot be relied Moreover the PW192 admitted
 140623
that Ext P18,registration form does not contain the name of the accused
no.2,i.e,in the registration form itself shows the name of accused no.1 and not

the accused no2 as its responsible person.

47. Prosecution had not adduced any doment to show that the accused no.2 was
authorized foreman of the chitty fund institution or he has run the bank. As per
Ext. P19 the managing director of the said bank is accused no,1. There is no
direct evidence to show that the accused no2 received money and
‘misappropriated it .On analysing the oral as well as the documentary evidence
adduced by the prosecution the role of accused no.2 cannot be said to have

proved by the prosecution with respect to the offence w/s.420 IPC

48.The another allegation is that the accused has committed the offence w/s.17 of
Kerala Money Lenders Act 1958 Section 17: Penalty for carrying on

business without licence or in violation of the conditions of licence.

49. Whoever carries on the business of money lending without a licence or in
violation of the conditions of the licence or otherwise than in conformity with
the terms and conditions of the licence shall be punished with imprisonment
for a term which, in the absence of special reasons to be recorded in the
judgement of the court, shall not be less than three months but which may
extend to three years and with fine which may extend to fifty thousand

rupees.".]
 15 0f 23
50, The defence case is that the accused no.2 is a KSRTC employee .More over the
prosecution has not adduced any evidence to prove that the accused no2 was
running the business without any valid license .Ext P18 form issued in the
name of accused no.1 -The Ext P7 rent deed was executed by accused no.1,
Ext. P19 issued by the district registrar in which the accused no.1 is the

foreman,the Ext P18 Form A_which shows that the firm was registered in the

year 1985,j.e before the death of P.K.Kunju . The details of partners after the
death of him or after the reconstitution of the firm were not
produced .Furthermore there is no evidence to show that the accused no.2 was
running the business . Hence it cannot be said that the accused no.2 without
valid license run the firm. The available evidence on record is hardly
sufficient to find that the accused no.2 committed any offence ws. 420 read
with 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money
Lenders Act, 1958 as alleged by the prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt

For said reasons point nos. 1 and 2 are found against the prosecution.

51, Point No,

Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, accused No.2 is found
not guilty of offences punishable under sections 420 read with 34 of Indian
Penal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money Lenders Act, 1958
and he is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) of Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. His bail bonds stand cancelled and he is set at

liberty. Case against accused No.1 is split up and refiled as CC. 01/2025.
