P.S. To JUDGE
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 4” day of August, 2016
ORDER

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
leamed Standing Counsel for the CBI.

2. The learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed
out that the petitioner has undergone a surgery by way of
Angioplasty on 13.07.2016 and he is on rest at Madurai. It
has been pointed out that it will be tedious for him to travel
all the way from Madurai to Kochi to attend the case, as he
has to take rest for two more weeks.

3. At the same time, the leamed Standing Counsel
for the CBI has pointed out that three cases were scheduled
for trial before the court below and the other two cases had

to be adjourned since the accused absconded. In case the
 CRLM.C.No, 4893 of 2016

present trial is adjourned, there would not be any work in the
court below during that period.

4. Considering the circumstances pointed out by the
learned counsel for the petitioner and the anguish
expressed by him, this Court is of the view that the court
below can be directed to grant exemption to the petitioner
from personal appearance as far as practicable. As far as
practicable, the court below shall grant exemption to the
petitioner, liberally. His presence shall be insisted only on
the dates on which his presence is actually required for
identification in the case before the court below. The court
below shall grant such accommodation to the petitioner as
far as practicable.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the above
direction.
