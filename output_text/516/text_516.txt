SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Dated this the 3° day of October, 2016
ORDER

These proceedings are initiated by the accused
in Crime Nos.738 of 2016, 863 of 2016 and 864 of
2016 of Paravoor Police Station.

2. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5835 of
2016, the case of the de facto complainant is that
on 16.05.2016, at 9.00 pm, the accused in
furtherance of the common intention trespassed into
the residential house of the de facto complainant
and when she objected to it, they attacked her,
assaulted her, tore her blouse and thereby,
attempted to outrage her modesty. When the husband
interfered, he was also assaulted with a reaper. The
complaint was laid and crime was registered for

offences punishable under Sections 452, 354, 323,
 2016KERIA22IS

CHAM, Nos, 826, 5895.4 598 of 2016

324, 427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code.

3. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5838 of
2016, the 2” accused in Crime No.863 of 2016 is the
de facto complainant. Her case is that on
16.05.2016, at about 9.15 pm, the accused herein
attempted to damage a car parked near the residence
of the de facto complainant and attempted to beat

the de facto complainant using an iron rod. The 2%

and 3% accused had hit with an iron rod causing
bodily injuries to him and his brother. The crime
was registered against three persons, who are the
accused herein. In the nature of the allegations
raised in these cases, it is clear that they are

case and counter case.

4. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5826 of
 2016KERIA22IS

CHAM, Nos, 826, 5895.4 598 of 2016

2016, the 1* accused in Crime No.864 of 2016 is the
sole accused. The de facto complainant therein is
the complainant in Crime No.864 of 2016. The
allegation of the de facto complainant therein is
that on 11.03.2016, at about 10.30 pm the accused
trespassed into the residential house of the de
facto complainant, abused him and pushed him down,
to the verandha, tore his shirt and assaulted him.
It is alleged that some household articles were
also damaged. On the basis of the complaint lodged,
crime was registered and after investigation final
report was laid and the matter is pending as C.C.
No.738 of 2016.

5. The respective accused in all the three
cases have approached this Court with these cases

contending that the dispute between the parties have
 2016KERIA22IS

CHAM, Nos, 826, 5895.4 598 of 2016
nae

been resolved amicably and voluntarily. The
affidavits filed by the respective de facto
complainants and the victims have been filed in each
of the above case. The learned counsel for the de
facto complainant in the respective cases, relying
on the affidavits filed by the aggrieved persons,
contended that they indicate the true and correct
facts and reiterated the averments in the
affidavits. It was contended that they do not intend
to pursue the respective cases.

6. The learned Public Prosecutor on
instructions submitted that the parties are not
involved in any other crime and that parties have
resolved their disputes. Having heard the learned
counsel for the respective petitioners and the

respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor, I am
 2016KERIA22IS

CHAM, Nos, 826, 5895.4 598 of 2016

satisfied that the parties have resolved their
disputes. In the interest of justice, a premature
termination of the entire proceedings is warranted.
Hence I am inclined to invoke Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and quash the
entire proceedings.

In the result, all the Criminal Miscellaneous
Cases are allowed and Crime Nos.738 of 2016, 863 of
2016 and 864 of 2016 of Paravoor Police Station will

stand quashed.
