On appearance of the accused Nos. 1 to 3 they were enlarged on bail on

explained to the accused Nos. 1 to 3, to which they pleaded not guilty and

claimed to be tried,

On the side of prosecution, PW1 was examined and Exhibit P1 was marked.
‘As the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the learned

Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CW2 to CW14. In the absence of any
 406

incriminating circumstances against the accused Nos. 1 to 3, questioning of the
accused Nos! to 3, under section 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
‘was dispensed with. Accused Nos. 1 to 3. were called upon to adduce
evidence but no defence evidence was adduced from the side of the accused

Nos 1 to 3.

Heard both sides and perused records,

(1) Whether accused Nos. 1 to 3, in furtherance of their common intention
subjected CW1, Lijimol to cruelty, both physical and mental demanding
dowry on several days from the year 16.06.2015 to 15.09.2017, at the house
TC. 46/1014(1), Near Milk Colony, Manikyavilakom Ward, Muttathara

Point_No.l:- Prosecution case is that accused have committed offence
punishable under section 498(A) read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code,

1860

PW1 Lijimol admitted her signature in Ext. P1 statement. She deposed that

accused no.1 is her husband and accused persons have not assaulted her and
 506

she has no grievance against the accused persons. According to her she is not

intended to proceed with the case.

10, The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and she
is justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of

prosecution. Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view

that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused Nos. 1 to 3 and for the

said reason this point is found against the prosecution.

found not of offence punishable under section 498(A) read with section

34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said offence under
