learned counsel submitted that ,the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
that the accused persons have the intention to cheat PW! .Furthermore the role
of accused no2 and 3 is not categorically stated and allegations made against

2s. Evaluation of the evidence ; PWI and PW2 are husband and wife . The

intention after conspiracy entered into an agreement for sale with PW1
Dhanya and obtained Rs .4 lakh from her . PW1 ,PW2 and PW4 were material

disputed by accused persons ,in fact the existence of agreement is admitted by
the defence . Now let's examine whether the prosecution has proved the
offence of cheating and criminal conspiracy .PW1 admitted that she and her
family reside in the Greeshmam house ,which was handed over to her by the
accused no.1 soon after the execution of the agreement for sale . In order to
attract the offence of cheating the following elements are to be proved :

(i) the deception of any person,

any person,

and (fii) mens rea or dishonest intention of the accused at the time of making

the inducement.

lakh rupees as advance ,though she denied the existence of such an agreement

agreement according to PW1 produced before the Honourable Sub Court,
‘Thiruvananthapuram in OS No. 1280/2011 and later the certified copy of the

said agreement accused no.1 agreed to execute the sale deed after clearing the
‘mortgage and other liabilities that exists over the said property .During cross
‘examination of PW1 she also admitted that she was aware of the liabilities over

the property ,when she was asked about her knowledge about the liabilities she

marked as Ext. D1 through her. The receipt, acknowledged the receipt of key

of the Greesmam House by PW1.

27. PW2 Binu denied the agreement dated 7.10.2011 according to him there is
only one agreement that is the Ext P2 and he had seen the original ttle deed of
the said property . When he was asked about the advocate notices issued by his
counsel, he gave a negative answer , ‘oocnanilost evsaio pom 22>
andleraiand ars) aiaslas omaghv’ cowajloay apa asosnm208 awaom a1

also he gave such an answer When he was asked about the notices issued by

hhim and PW1 through their cousel calling the accused to perform their part he

replied that ‘4028 eacinKwlas’ aveminan’ anaKesogiseomy aioamocs

ostwoan*, The Ext P2 agreement was dated 29.3,2012 ,as per the agreement

the sale deed has to be executed with in 3 months from the date of execution of
Ext P2,whereas the notice was sent by the PW1 through her counsel on

30.12.2013 calling them to perform their part ,the said original notice was

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 16 0f 26
produced by the accused no.1 and marked as Ext DS (a) the copy of reply

notice sent by the accused no.1 through her counsel was marked as Ext D6
subject to proof .The accused no.1 had produced the copy of advocate notice
issued by her counsel dated 30.8.2013 was produced and marked as Ext D4
subject to proof ,the original reply sent by advocate under the instructions of
PW2 Binu was marked as Ext D5.The Ext DS (a) original notices shows that
PWI called the accused no.1 to perform her part after one and half years i.e,
after the accused no.1 issued notice to her . Though PW2 denied the notice
issued by his counsel under his instruction ,the original notices itself speak the
readiness and willingness of accused no. to perform her part. The transaction
is unchallenged by the defence ,the defence admits the transaction ,which was
witnessed by PW4 Kumar . He was examined by the prosecution to prove the
transactions, which is unchallenged. His version is that after the execution of
agreement for sale PW1 and PW2 were verified the encumbrance
certificate .PW3 Anilkumar who is not conversant with the transaction that had
taken place between PW1 and the accused no.1 claims that after the execution
of Ext D2 agreement for sale the original title deed is with him .Whereas
PW1 and PW2 deposed that they had verified the original title deed and its

prior deed at the time of executing Ext P2 However PW2 stated that the title

deed was not shown by PW3 Anilkumar, ‘aomiaiooss agent aioayrn angoor

(umane soamlay Omen ainsao208 «ology, Moreover PW3 admitted that

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 170626

he was committed default in performing the Ext D2 agreement for sale that
‘was entered into between him and accused no.1 and thereafter he had never
approached the accused nol to execute the sale deed The evidence of PW1
and PW2 is contradictory as to the part showing their readiness and

willingness to perform the contract. ‘Though prosecution alleges that the

accused no.1 concealed the fies from PW1 ,PWI herself admits her

knowledge about the liabilities in her cross examination,

28.The next thing that has to be considered is the role of accused no.2 and 3.
Only the accused nol and Pwi were the parties to Ext P2 agreement .The
prosecution allegation is that the accused no.1 to 3 were conspiring to cheat
PW1 .The following elements have to be proved by the prosecution in order to
attract the offence w/s.120 B :

1) Agreement: There must be an agreement between two or more persons.
2) Illegal Act: The agreement must be for committing an illegal act or an act by
illegal means.

3) Intent to Commit an Offense: The agreement must be specifically to commit

an offense as defined under the IPC.

Going by the facts and evidence of the case ,there is no evidence to prove that

the accused no.1 to 3 were involved in a criminal conspiracy .

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 18 0f 26

29.The next is whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution is sufficient to
prove the offence w/s.420 of the Indian Penal Code or not ? The allegation is
that by concealing the liability, Ext P2 agreement was executed and later
committed default in executing the sale deed <There was civil dispute between
parties before the honourable sub court ,Thiruvananthapuram for specific
performance of contract as OS $1/2015.Now the question is whether non
performance of contract for sale of an immovable property would attract the

offence w/s.420 of IPC has to be exat

ined . $.420, IPC provides that:
"Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to
deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or
any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and
which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished
‘with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven
years, and shall also be liable to fine.”

For an offence under $.420, IPC, the following ingredients must be present: i.

Cheating as defined under S.415, IPC, that is, there should be a fraudulent or
dishonest inducement of a person;

ii, An intention to deceive; and

iii. The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to

a, Deliver property to any person; or

b. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and

capable of being converted into valuable security.

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 19 0f 26

30.In SureshKumar K y. Venugopalan P 2024 KLT (1)186 it was observed by
the honorable apex court that “The ingredient which would constitute ‘cheating’
as defined under $.415 IPC is an inseparable part of offence punishable under
$.420 IPC. Hence, when there is delivery of any property either movable or
immovable or money in trust for the performance of contractual obligation
arising out of a contract for sale, unless there is “inducement” to deliver such
property or to enter into a contract, it would not attract the criminal liability
under the said provision even if it is found that the contract was entered into
and the other person had entertained a dishonest intention at that time, There
should be something to show that the other person was compelled or persuaded
to enter into such contract and deliver any money or property. If the existence
of dishonest intention is of such a nature sufficient to persuade the other
directly or indirectly to enter into a contract or to deliver property, it would fall
under the mischief of "inducement", When the contract contains a specific
clause that the seller should clear out all existing liabilities over the property
which is the subject of the contract within the period of contract or within a
specified time, it would constitute a contractual obligation on that party to
perform it within the time agreed into. Necessarily, the existence of liability
over the property at the time when the contract was entered will stand subject
to the above said contractual obligation to be performed on a future date,

hence, non - disclosure of any such liability at the time when the contract was

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 20 0f 26

entered into cannot be brought under the purview of “cheating” as defined
under $.415 IPC, even if it involves payment of money or delivery of
possession of property. A mere obligation though involves monetary transfer by
way of advance or eamest money cannot be brought under the purview of

“delivery of property under deception", unless involves "

purpose of attracting either of the offences viz., $.418 and S.420 IPC. The
primary requirement to make out an offence of “cheating”, the inseparable part
of both the offences under $.418 and S.420 IPC is the existence of dishonest or
fraudulent “inducement”. The existence of fraudulent or dishonest intention
‘may not be sufficient, unless it carries the necessary vital ingredient persuading
the other or compelling the other directly or indirectly to enter into the
agreement or to deliver such property. Hence, a mere non - disclosure of a
liability over the property unless coupled with the necessary intention of
deception and inducement cannot be brought under the purview of criminal
liability under $.418 and $.420 IPC. But the legal position would be different
‘when there is assertion in the contract with respect to non - existence of any
liability or a declaration to that effect, which would by its nature constitute the
required "inducement" with the dishonest intention. In short, mere non -
disclosure of any liability over the property at the time when the contract was
entered into for the sale of property with the specific understanding that all
liabilities will be cleared before the execution of the sale deed would not attract,

the criminal liability either under $.418 or $.420 IPC, unless there is an

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 21 0f 26

assertion / declaration to the contrary in the contract. Subsequent failure to
comply with the condition agreed into would fall within the mischief of breach
of an obligation arising out of contract, for which no criminal liability can be

fastened either under $.418 or $.420 IPC’.

31.In Radheyshyam v. State of Rajasthan (2024 KHC 6449), the same question
‘was discussed by the honourable apex court and observed that “ Mere non -
performance of an Agreement to Sell by itself does not amount to cheating and
breach of trust. Respondent no.2 has adequate remedy of filing a Civil Suit for
relief of specific performance of a contract which he has already availed and
the suit is still pending, The FIR only appears to be an arm ~ twisting
‘mechanism to pressurise the appellants to execute the Sale Deed or to extract
‘money. Every civil wrong cannot be converted into a criminal wrong. As we
find in the present case, respondent no,2 is trying to abuse the criminal

‘machinery for ulterior motives’.

32, Going by the facts of the case itis clear that as agreed in Ext P2 the possession
of the said property was delivered to PW1 and first part of Ext P2 was
performed -Then the next question is who failed to execute the sale deed ,how
ever the proof of readiness and willingness as well as the proof that who failed
to perform the contract ,all are purely in civil nature ,though it is so,in order to

decide the said question arose in the present case that whether the accused

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 22.0626
no.1 duped PWI or not,the elements of cheating must be proved by the

prosecution .The Ext D5 (a)notice sent by PW1 through her counsel after one
and half months from the date of Ext P2,before that on September, 2013 Ext.
D5 reply notice was sent by PW1 to the notice already sent to her by the
accused no.1 .Prosecution has neither produced any notices as issued by PW1
calling the accused no.1 to perform the contract nor has the case that such a
notice has sent before Ext D5(a) . PWS and PW7 deposes that the property had

liability to the bank ,the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is insufficient to hold that

they had no knowledge about the liability over the property .Further the case of
PW1 was that she and PW2 came to know about the liability from a
‘newspaper advertisement, which is not produced by the prosecution, When the

facts of the case is analysed in the light of judgments of Honourable Apex

Court cited above, it can be seen that there is specific recital in the Ext.P2

agreement that the property has liability, the wordings that “agi mowyoago

ag anwsoags ata’, there is nothing contrary to that, it is not stated in the

agreement that the property is free from any liability. Hence it cannot be said
that the accused persons were concealed the liability over the property.
Another aspect in the prosecution has to prove the malafide intention of the
accused no.1 at the time of entering into Ext. P2 agreement, ie, her dishonest

intention to cheat PW1, there is recital in the agreement as to the liability over

the property as well as PW1 also submits that the possession was delivered to

Judgment in CC. 1232015
 23.0626
them with the intention to execute the deed. On analysing all these things ,it

cannot be said that the accused persons have the criminal intention to cheat
PW at the time of entering into the agreement were committed the offence of
cheating w/s.420 of the Indian Penal Code1860.

Regarding the offence w/s.406 Of IPC the following elements must be proved :

i, The accused was entrusted with property, or entrusted with domi
property;

ii, The accused had dishonestly misappropriated or converted to their own use
that property, or dishonestly used or disposed of that property or wilfully suffer
any other person to do so; and

ili. Such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal should be in violation of
any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be
discharged, or of any legal contract which the person has made, touching the

discharge of such trust.

33.Coming to the facts of the present case PW1 had given Rs.4 lakh as advance as
part of Ext P2 agreement, which is purely a civil transaction ,apart from that
there is no entrustment of any property to the accused no.1 to 3 .Since there is
ho entrustment of property it cannot be said that the accused persons were
committed the offence w/s.406 of IPC . For said reasons these point nos. 1 to 3

are found against the prosecution.

Judgment in CC. 1232015

34, Point No.4 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 to 3, accused Nos. 1 to 3 are

under section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Their bail bonds
