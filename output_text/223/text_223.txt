“CALM. No.397 of 2010,
Dated this the 1" day of January, 2014.
ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.167 of 2006 of Kasaba
Police Station, Kozhikode registered under Section 126 of the
Representation of the People Act, 1951 (in short, “the Act"), The matter is
pending before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kozhikode as
C.C.No.115 of 2007.

2. Allegation against the petitioner, in brief, is that while the
petitioner was functioning as AICC Working Committee member, he held a
press conference at Hotel Malabar Palace, Kozhikode on 28.04.2006 at
about 11 a.m. in violation of the provisions contained in Section 126 of the
‘Act. Section 126 of the Act reads as follows:

“Prohibition of public meetings during
period of forty-eight hours ending with hour
fixed for conclusion of poll (1) No person
shall

(2) convene, hold, attend, join or address

any public meeting or procession in connection

with an election; or
 ‘caste na3972010 2

(b) display to the public any election
matter by means of cinematograph, television or
other similar apparatus; or

(c) propagate any election matter to the
public by holding, or by arranging the holding of,
any musical concert or any theatrical performance
or any other entertainment or amusement with a
view to attracting the members of the public
thereto,
in any polling area during the period of forty-eight
hours ending with the hour fixed for the conclusion
of the poll for any election in that polling area.
(2) Any person who contravenes the provisions
of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
(3) In this section, the expression “election
‘matter’ means any matter intended or calculated to

influence or affect the result of election.”

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Public Prosecutor.
4, Leamed counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

prosecution is legally unsustainable for multiple reasons, According to him,
the offence alleged to have been committed by the petitioner is not a
cognizable offence. Sub-section (2) of Section 126 of the Act would show
that the punishment prescribed is upto two years imprisonment and
therefore, it can only be regarded as a summons case defined in Section 2
(w) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, “the Cr.PC."). My
attention was drawn to Sections 129, 130, 132 and 134 of the Act. Section
182 of the Act deals with penalty for misconduct at the polling station,
The offence prescribed under Section 132 of the Act is made cognizable
by the statute itself. To buttress the contention that the prosecution is bad,
leamed counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme
Court in Jeewan Kumar Raut & another v. Central Bureau of
Investigation (AIR 2009 SC 2763). That was a case involving an offence
punishable under Section 22 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act,
1994. Considering the statutory provisions, the Supreme Court held that
the offence therein could be taken cognizance only on a complaint made
by the appropriate authority or person and not by registering a FIR. This
Court while considering the provisions of Protection of River Banks and
Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001 held in Abdul Azeez v. State of
Kerala (2010 (1) KLT 394) that the offences under the Sand Act cannot be

‘suo motu taken by the Police under the provisions of the Cr.PC.

AMC Na3972010 4
Considering these submissions, | am satisfied that the launching of
prosecution is not legally sustainable.

5. On facts also, submitted the leamed counsel for the
petitioner, the statements produced along with the final report will not show
that there was a press conference held by the petitioner as alleged by the
prosecution. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that he occupied a
room in the hotel and some press people might have contacted him at his
room. It is further contended that this cannot be termed as a press
conference attracting the offence under Section 126 of the Act. 1am
satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case that the alleged offence is
not attracted in this case. Therefore | find that the petition is to be allowed
to meet the ends of justice.

In the result, the petition is allowed. Final report in C.C.No.115
of 2007 on the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kozhikode is hereby
quashed.

All pending intertocutory applications will stand dismissed.

‘A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.
