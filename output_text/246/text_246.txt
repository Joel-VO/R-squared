P.UBAID, J.

Crl.M.C No.621 of 2015

Dated this the 5 day of May, 2015
ORDER

The petitioner seeks orders quashing the F.LR
and further proceedings in Crime No.374/2014 of the Upputhara
Police Station, Idukki registered under Sections 452, 354(A)(1),
354(A)(2) and 354(B) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint
of one Sumi, Orders are sought on the ground of amicable
settlement of the whole dispute between the accused and the de
facto complainant out of court. The de facto complainant Sumi

is the 2™ respondent in this proceeding brought under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He has filed affidavit to
the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused
and he has no grievance or complaint

2, In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable
offences, the High Court can quash the prosecution; be it at the
crime stage or at the trial stage or even at the appellate or
revisional stage; if the parties have really settled the whole

dispute, or if continuance of the prosecution will not serve any
 201SKER7S71

caM.c Neat of 2015 2
purpose. Here, I find a real case of settlement between the
parties, and I also find that continuance of prosecution in such a
situation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the
precious time of the court, when the case ultimately comes
before the court.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The F.LR and
further proceedings in crime No.374/2014 of the Upputhara
Police Station, Idukki will stand quashed under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
