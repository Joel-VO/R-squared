Cri. M. C. No. 4904 of 2016

Dated this the 3” day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in C.C.No.1257/2013
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Paravoor arising from
Crime No.71/2001 for offences punishable under Sections 323,
341, 498A and 34 of IPC.

2. The wife of the petitioner herein filed a complaint
alleging matrimonial cruelty against the petitioner herein and the
in-laws. After investigation, final report was laid and the matter is

pending as C.C.No.391/2001. Since the peti

ler herein was not
available for trial, the other accused faced the trial and they were
acquitted. The case against the petitioner herein was split up and
is now pending as C.C.No.1257/2013.

3. The petitioner claims that, he was employed abroad
and was out of station in connection with his employment. He
contends that, he has never ran away from the jurisdiction of the
court and is ready and willing to surrender before the competent
court. However, his apprehension is that, if an application for bail
is filed, it is not likely to be taken up on the same day and he is

likely to be remanded.

Cri. M, C. No, 4904 of 2016

Having regard to the limited prayer now sought, | am
inclined to grant the relief to the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C. is
disposed of with a direction that in the event of the petitioner
herein surrendering before the court below and filing an
application for bail, the same shall be considered by the court

below on the same day, having regard to the facts of the case.
