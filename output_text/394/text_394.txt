‘HE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 2020KERAT

ORDER

The accused came up to quash the FIR registered on
the allegation of malpractice committed by the accused
in transferring the interest of the defacto complainant
over the management of a school in favour of a third
person, under the guise of a power of attorney (R2(b))
alleged to have been executed by the defacto
complainant. A mere perusal of the power of attorney
would show that it is only a special power of attorney
given only for the purpose of managing the affairs of
the school. No right of transfer or alienation given
under the power of attorney. This would show what is
behind it. The alleged act of the accused would prima
facie satisfy the ingredient which would constitute the
offence alleged. Hence, there is no ground for
exhausting the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.c.

Crl.M.c. is dismissed accordingly.
