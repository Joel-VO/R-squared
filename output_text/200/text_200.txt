BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C. No. 259 of 2024

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioners are facing a prosecution in a proceeding under
Section 138 of the Negoitable Instruments Act (for short ‘the
Nl. Act") as C.C No.2936 of 2014 on the files of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-|, Kasaragod.

2. Due to the failure of the petitioners to appear before
the court, a non bailable warrant was issued against them and
the case has even be transferred to the Long Pending Register.

3. Sri. G. Hariharan, the learned counsel contended that,
though petitioners are ready and willing to appear before the
court and participate in the trial, since the case has been
transferred to the Long Pending Register, there is every
possibility that the petitioners will be remanded on the date of
their appearance before considering the application. Therefore,
petitioners seek for a direction to consider the application on
the same day itself.

4. | have heard Smt. Sreeja V., learned Public
 224KERSO8
CRL.MC NO. 259 OF 2024

Prosecutor as well. Considering the nature of the order that |
proposed to issue notice to respondent No.1 is dispensed with.

5. Even though, the case against the petitioners have
been transferred to the Long Pending Register on 30.11.2019,
since the petitioners have expressed their willingness to
appear before the court and participate in the proceedings,
taking note of the circumstances of the case, | am of the view
that, a lenient view can be adopted.

Accordingly, if the petitioners appear before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod in C.C No.2936 of
2014 (now transferred as LPC 155/2019) and files an
application for recall of warrant and for grant of bail, learned
Magistrate shall consider the same, and pass appropriate
orders on the same day itself. To enable the petitioners to
appear before the court as directed above, the warrant issued

against the petitioners will be kept in abeyance till 22.01.2024.
