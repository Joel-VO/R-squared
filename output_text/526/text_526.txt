ORDER

The petitioner is the first accused in CC.No.1213 of 2016

on the files of the Court of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class
IX, Ernakulam. According to the petitioner, as he has shifted his
residence to his present address in Tamil Nadu, he did not receive
the summons issued to him. It is stated that the learned
Magistrate in the circumstances issued warrant of arrest against
the petitioner. The petitioner is prepared to surrender before the
court below, but he apprehends that if he surrenders, he will be
remanded to judicial custody. The petitioner, therefore, seeks
directions to the court below to recall the warrant of arrest issued
against him and enlarge him on bail on his appearance.

2. Should the warrant of arrest issued against the
petitioner be recalled and should he be released on bail are
matters for the learned Magistrate to consider. There is absolutely
no reason to think that if the petitioner surrenders before the
court below and satisfactorily explain the cause for his non-
appearance, the learned Magistrate would mechanically remand

him to custody, without considering the application for bail

CHLM.C.No 5985 of 2019 3

However, having regard to the submissions made at the
Bar, this Crl.M.C. is closed, with a direction to the court below that
if the petitioner applies for bail on surrender, the same shall be
considered and disposed of on the date of surrender itself, with

notice to the Assistant Public Prosecutor.
