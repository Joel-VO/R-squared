SUNIL THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.292 of 2017

Dated this the 13" day of January, 2017
ORDER

Petitioner herein is the 5® accused in a proceeding

arising from Crime No.237 of 2010 of Vazhakkad Police Station for
offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 450, 436, 427 r/
149 of Indian Penal Code.

2. The matter was pending as S.C.No.375 of 2011 before
the Additional Sessions Court, Adhoc-I, Manjeri. Pending the
proceedings, Annexure-A2 order was issued by the Government
permitting withdrawal of the case with the permission of the Court.
Consequently, Annexure-A3 application was submitted by the
Additional Public Prosecutor and by order in Cri.M.P.No.1504 of
2012 in the above sessions case, all the accused who faced the trial
were discharged. Petitioner herein and the other accused who did
not participate were left out. Case of the petitioner herein is now
pending as L.P.No.94 of 2012 in C.P.No.44 of 2011.

3. Having considered the fact that Annexure-A4 judgment
has become final and conclusive and the Government order

produced as Annexure-A4 is in relation to the withdrawal of the case
 2017%KERI2062

as such, necessarily, it should enure to the benefit of the petitioner
herein who also stood as accused, though had not participated in
S.C.No.375 of 2011. Having regard to these facts, I feel that no
purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioner herein since all
other main accused remain discharged. In the light of above, 1 am
inclined to quash the criminal proceedings.

In the result, Cri.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings
arising from Crime No.237 of 2010 of Vazhakkad Police Station
stand quashed
