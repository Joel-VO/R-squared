Cri. M. C. No. 7302 of 2016

Dated this the 10" day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner is the sole accused in S.C. No.206/2016 of
Additional Sessions Court IV, Kottayam in Crime No.186/2012 of
Kottayam West Police Station for offences punishable under
Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 326 & 307 read with 149 IPC. He
stood charge sheeted along with the other accused in the above
crime. The petitioner herein was not available for trial. By
Annexure A3 judgment in SC No.219/2013 all other accused
except the petitioner and another accused, who was arrayed as
‘AS and A6 were acquitted. The petitioner claims that he was in
Gulf country and was not aware of the proceedings, has
approached this Court seeking to quash the proceedings on the
ground that the entire substratum of the case is lost and that he
is entitled to the same benefit. Records reveal that by Annexure
‘A3 judgment, other accused were acquitted holding that there
was absolutely no evidence to connect them with the incident.

2. The learned Public Prosecutor on _ instructions

submitted that the petitioner herein is not involved in any other
 2017KERIIDS
(Crl.M, C. No, 7302 of 2016

case and that Annexure A3 judgment is not challenged in any
other proceedings. Evidently, it has become final.

3. Having regard to these facts, | feel that the petitioner
herein is also entitled for the relief since the substratum of the
entire prosecution case is lost by Annexure A3 judgment. Hence,

Iam inclined to allow the Crl.M.C, as against the petitioner herein

in S.C. No.206/2016 of Additional Sessions Court - IV, Kottayam,

now pending trial.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed as above.
