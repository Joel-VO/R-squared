Cri.M.C.No.33 of 2024

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner challenges Annexure A1 order issued by the Sub
Divisional Magistrate, Fort Kochi under Section 111 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the Cr.P.C.'). As per the impugned
order, the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate recorded that he is prima
facie convinced that the petitioner herein causes threat to the public
peace and tranquility and security proceedings under Section 107 of the
Cr.P.C. are liable to be initiated against him.

2. Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saher, the learned counsel for the petitioner
vehemently contended that the procedure carried out by the learned Sub
Divisional Magistrate is wrong in law especially since except one case, all
other cases referred to in Annexure A1 have either been compounded or
settled and therefore those cases cannot be relied upon to invoke
proceedings under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C. or issue an order under
Section 111 of the Cr.P.C. It is further submitted that the report of the
Investigating Officer to the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate was on
12.03.2022 while the impugned order was issued only on 20.05.2023.

3. [have heard Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saheer, the learned counsel for

the petitioner as well as Sri.C.S.Hrithwik, the learned Public Prosecutor.

CRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024

4, The impugned order is issued under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C.
The said order is only the beginning of an enquiry proceeding under
Section 116 of the Cr.P.C. Petitioner will have all the opportunity to
controvert the prima facie observations of the learned Sub Divisional
Magistrate as recorded in Annexure Al in the enquiry proceedings.
Further, it is noticed that the impugned order is issued on 20.05.2023
while this Cri.M.C.is filed after almost 7 months, though the petitioner has
a case that the order was served on him only recently.

5. Be that as it may, as the order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C.
is subject to an enquiry proceedings to be carried out under Section 116
of the Cr.P.C., this Court is of the view that petitioner has sufficient
remedy available under law to bring to the notice of the learned
Magistrate the entire contention that he intends to take.

6. Since the petitioner has an effective opportunity as per the
provisions of Section 116 of the Cr.P.C., there is no merit in this Crl.M.C.
and the same is dismissed.

‘The contentions raised by the petitioner in this Cri.M.C. are kept
open to be raised before the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate during the
enquiry proceedings.
