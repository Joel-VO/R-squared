BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Crl.M.C.No.196 of 2024

Dated this the 10 day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.414 of 2020 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-1, Thamarassery alleging
offences under Sections 341 and 323 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.

2. According to the prosecution, on 12.03.2020 at about 5.50 a.m.,
while the defacto complainant was proceeding in a motor bike, the
accused intercepted him and dashed against his bike using a car and
thereafter assaulted him. While the 2° respondent tore the shirt of the
defacto complainant, the 3% accused restrained the defacto complainant
and thereby the accused committed the offences alleged

3. Sri.N.K.Shyju, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
that even going by the prosecution case as revealed from the statement
of the complainant and other witnesses, the offences as alleged are not
made out. The learned counsel relied upon two statements given by the
defacto complainant on 12.03.2020 and 13.03.2020 and pointed out that
discrepancy in the two statements is clearly evident indicating the falsity
of the prosecution case. It was further submitted that, if the trial is
permitted to take place, the same would cause great prejudice and hence

Section 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be invoked to quash the proceedings.

4. [have heard Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor as
well.

5. The nature of allegations as evidenced from the final report is
that the accused had assaulted the defacto complainant after hitting his
bike with a motor car. Of course on 13.03.2020 it is noticed that the

defacto complainant himself changed his stance and stated that he had

not hit the bike with the car, but when the defacto complainant fell down
he was assaulted. Anyway, considering the nature of allegations, it Is
evident that appreciation of evidence is essential to arrive at a conclusion.
Exercise of the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be
resorted to only in cases where the admitted allegations do not make out
any of the offences alleged.

6. In the instant case, the allegations in final report indicate the
commission of offence. Whether those allegations are true or not are all
matters of trial.

Therefore, I find that thi

is a case which requires appreciation of

evidence and the remedy under Section 482 Cr.P.C.cannot be invoked.
Hence, this Cri.M.C. is dismissed.
