JUDGMENT
1. This case has been arisen on a final report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,
 3

Cantonment Police Station in crime No. 1395/2016 alleging the commission of
offences against the accused under Sections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323
of the Indian Penal Code.

‘The prosecution case in brief is as follows:- Accused due to the enmity
towards the informant on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near University College,
Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor village, formed themselves into
an unlawful assembly, each of them knowing well aware that they were the
members of said unlawful assembly, accused no. 1 uttered obscene words
against the informant and accused no.2 wrongfully restrained him . Accused
no. 1 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant by fisted on his lips with his
hhand and hitting on his left shoulder and accused nos. 3 to 5 hitting and
beating on the various parts of his body, causing pain. Thereafter,Thereby the
accused alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections
143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code.

On the submission of final report by Sub Inspector of Police, Cantonment
Police Station, cognizance was taken by this court for the offences under
sections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. The case
‘was taken on file as. C.C 348/2017 against accused. Copies of relevant records
of the prosecution case and thereby complied with the mandate under section
207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. On hearing the learned Assistant
Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the accused and on perusal of
final report and documents sent with it under section 173 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. Thereafter, the accused nos. 3 to 5 were heard on
the charge levelled against them. Particulars of offence under Sections
143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code, read over them and

they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be
In the light of the denial of charge framed against accused nos. 3 to 5, the
prosecution was directed to adduce evidence to prove the charge against

accused. The prosecution cited witness Nos.1 to 7 in support of the prosecution
 4

case and as a first step for the prosecution evidence summons were issued to
prosecution witnesses. In response of it, the prosecution witness No.1
appeared and was examined as PWI and Ext.P1 was marked through PW1.

PW1 was examined from the side of prosecution and he tumed hostile. After

the examination of PWI, as the evidence of the remaining witnesses by itself

‘would not improve the prosecution case, remaining charge witnesses were

given up by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the prosecution
evidence was closed. Since there was no incriminating circumstances
appearing in evidence against accused Nos. 3 to 5, examination of accused
Nos. 3 to 5, under Section 313 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
were dispensed with.

5. No defence evidence from the side of the accused persons.

6. Heard both sides.

7. The point that arise for consideration are as follows:
1 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near

University College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor

village , in furtherance of common object, form themselves into an
unlawful assembly and thus alleged to have committed offence under
Section 143 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code?

2° Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near
University College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor
village, in furtherance of common object, and commit rioting and thus
alleged to have committed offence under Section 147 read with 149 of
the Indian Penal Code?

3. Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near
University College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor
village, in furtherance of common object, wrongfully restrain witness

no, 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed offence
 5

under Section 341 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code?

4 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near
University College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor
village, in furtherance of common object, voluntarily cause hurt to
witness no, 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed
offence under Section 323 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code?

5 _ Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near University
College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor village, in
furtherance of common objectutter obscene words against witness
‘no. 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed an offence

149 of the Indian Penal Code?

under section 294(b) read

6 If the accused found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?

8. Boint Nos.1 to 5:- For the sake of convenience, point Nos.1 to 5 are to be
considered together. PW1- Midhun is the informant in this case. PW1
deposed that regarding the incident, he had given statement to the Police and
the First Information Statement was marked as Ext.P1, He admitted his
signature in Ext.P1 First Information Statement.But he tured hostile to the
prosecution and deposed that he could not identify the person who attacked
him,

9, In the view of evidence of PWI and non examination of remaining
prosecution witnesses, there is no incriminating circumstance appearing in
evidence against the accused, hence examination of accused no. 3 to 5 under
section 313 (1) (b) of Cr.P.C was dispensed with,

10.On the backdrop of above discussion and in the view of evidence of
prosecution witnesses, I find that the prosecution has failed to establish the

offence alleged against the accused no. 3 to 5 beyond reasonable doubt. Hence,
 6

these points were found against the prosecution.

10.Point no, 6:-In view of my findings on Point Nos.1 to 5, it is found that the
accused no. 3 to 5 are found not guilty for the offences punishable under
sections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code

11.In the result, the accused nos. 3 to 5 are found not guilty and acquitted under
section 255(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offences under
Sections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. The bail
bonds of accused stand cancelled and they are set at liberty. Case against
accused nos. 1 and 2 is split up and refiled as CC No.434/2025
