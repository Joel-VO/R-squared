ORDER

1.The petitioner is the accused in L.P.No.37 of 2009 of the
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur. He along with 4 others
were initially charge sheeted by the Assistant Sub
Inspector of Police, Trissur East Police Station in Crime
No.349 of 1998 alleging offences punishable under
Sections 408 and 420 read with Section 34 of the IPC.

2.The learned counsel submits that all the other accused
except the petitioner were acquitted as per Annexure B
judgment. The petitioner was not available for trial and
the case against him was split up and re-filed and later
the case was included in the list of long pending case as
above. The petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate
directions to the learned Magistrate to consider his
application for recall of warrant and grant of Bail on the

date of surrender itself and to grant him Bail.

Cri.M.C, No.4873 of 2016 om

3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the

petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued against
him to secure his presence before the court below. This
court in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure will not be justified in interfering
with the discretion of the learned Magistrate in granting
bail.

4.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned Magistrate
and appraise the reasons for his absence and to seek for
recalling the warrant and grant of Bail. There is no reason
for this Court to assume that the learned Magistrate will
not exercise his discretion judicially and in accordance
with law.

5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender before
the learned Magistrate within 3 weeks from the date of
this order and prefer application for recall of warrant and
also for grant of bail with advance notice to the prosecutor

concerned. In that event the learned Magistrate is directed
 Cri.M.C, No.4873 of 2016 3.

to consider and dispose of the said application, preferably
on the same day itself, on its merits and in accordance
with law. Coercive proceedings, if any, shall be kept in
abeyance till then.
Petition is disposed off as above.
