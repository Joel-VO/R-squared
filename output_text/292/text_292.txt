“CriM.C.No.2173 of 2015

This is a petition filed by the petitioner challenging the
order in Crl.M.P.No.615/2014 in Crl.A.No.247/2014 on the file
of the First Additional Sessions Court, Mavelikara under
section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

2. It is alleged in the petition that the first respondent
herein filed M.C.No.15/2012 before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-1, Chengannur under section 12 of the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act claiming
maintenance and other reliefs. The learned magistrate allowed
the application in part and passed an ex parte order, against
which, the petitioner filed Crl.A.No.247/14 before the Sessions
Court, Alappuzha with delay condonation application, which was
made over to the First Additional Sessions Court, Mavelikara
for disposal and he filed Cri.M.P.No.615/2014 for suspending
the order passed by the court below and the learned First
Additional Sessions Judge earlier passed an order directing the

petitioner to deposit Rs.1,000/- per month from 13.12.2014.
 201KERATHT

(CHL. M.C.No.2173 of 2015, 2
Thereafter the petition was advanced and the date was
corrected from 13.2.2012 onwards and posted the case to
15.1.2015. This order is being challenged by the petitioner by
filing this petition.

3. On going through the allegations, this Court felt that
there is no necessity to interfere with the order and so decided
to dispose of the matter on admission itself dispensing with
notice to the first respondent after hearing the counsel for the
petitioner and the Public Prosecutor.

4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that his
grievance was that he was not liable to pay maintenance, but
the lower court passed an ex parte order which is being
challenged by the petitioner and earlier the First Additional
Sessions Judge has directed to deposit only Rs.1,000/- per month
from 13.12.2014, but later it was corrected as 13.2.2012,
which, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, is
not correct.

5. Heard the Public Prosecutor, Smt.M.T. Sheeba as well.

6. It is seen from the order that the lower court had
directed the petitioner to pay maintenance at the rate of

Rs.2,500/- per month from the date of petition namely 13.2.2012
 201KERATHT

CeLM.C.N02173 0f2015 3
and it was an ex parte order. This was challenged by the
petitioner by filing appeal with delay condonation application
and after delay was condoned, the learned First Additional
Sessions Judge inclined to stay execution of clause (b) of the
impugned order on condition of depositing Rs.1,000/- per
month from 13.12.2014 and it appears to be a mistake. When
this was realized, the learned First Additional Sessions Judge
after giving notice, suo motu advanced the petition, and since
no objection was filed, the learned First Additional Sessions
Judge corrected the date as 13.2.2012 because the appellate
court had reduced the order of maintenance to be paid to
Rs.1,000/- from the date of petition as ordered by the court
below which cannot be said to be illegal. So there is no
necessity to interfere with the order passed by the court below
as no illegality has been committed by the court below in this
regard.

7. While this Court was about to dispose of the petition,
the counsel for the petitioner submitted that a direction may
be given to the lower court to dispose of the appeal itself
within time bound manner. Considering the legislative intention

of enacting the provision and also considering the mandate
 201KERATHT

CeLM.C.N02173 0f2015 4
provided under the Statute to dispose of the cases filed under
the Act at the earliest time under section 12 of the Act itself,
this Court feels that the First Additional Sessions Judge,
Mavelikara can be directed to dispose of the appeal itself as
early as possible, at any rate, within three months from the date
of re-opening the court after summer vacation. The petitioner
is granted one months time to deposit the amount as directed
by the court below. Till then, coercive steps, if any, taken as
directed to be kept in abeyance. The Additional Sessions
Judge, Mavelikkara is directed to dispose of the appeal itself
as directed above.

With the above directions and observations, this petition is
disposed of.
