ORDER

The petitioner seeks orders quashing the crime
and further proceedings as against him in Crime No. 1 of
2014 of the Excise Enforcement and Anti Narcotic Squad,
Idukki. His case is that he has nothing to do with the
allegations made in the crime report. The petitioner has
produced the copy of an intimation received by him from the
office of the CB-CID, which shows that steps were being, at
that time, taken to drop the proceedings against him. In
view of such a report, the prosecution was directed by this
Court on 22.11.2017 to file a report as to whether the crime
as against the petitioner is being referred, or whether he has
been removed from the array of accused. Now it is
submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the
investigating officer has already filed report in the court

below on 09.08.2017 dropping the further proceedings

against the petitioner. If so, there is no proceeding to be
quashed by this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.. The
submission made by the learned Public Prosecutor is
recorded in the proceedings. In case anything happened
otherwise, contrary to the submissions made by the learned
Public Prosecutor, the officer who gave instructions to the
learned Public Prosecutor will have to be dealt with, and
appropriate proceedings can be initiated by the petitioner.

In the above circumstances, this application is

closed.
