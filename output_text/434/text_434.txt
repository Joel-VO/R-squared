 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V, J

Cri.M.C. No.4855 of 2016
Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016
ORDER

1.A complaint was filed by the Food Inspector,
Thalassery against the petitioner and two others
alleging commission of offence punishable under
sections 16(1)(a)(i) read with section 7(1) and 2(1)(a)
of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The
petitioner is the owner of a grocery shop of which the
1 accused in the said complaint was a salesman.

2.The prosecution allegation is that the Food Inspector
had purchased 450 grams of coffee, which when sent
to the public analyst, was found adulterated. The 3
accused in the aforesaid complaint was the

manufacturer of the food item. The case was
 2016KERI33670

(CALM.C.4855/2016

proceeded with and by Annexure-A judgment dated
11.10.1985, the learned Magistrate had extended the
benefit of doubt to the manufacturer and convicted the
1st accused, who was the salesman of the shop. The
petitioner was not available for trial. The case against
him was split up and refilled.

3.Challenging the finding of guilt, the 1* accused
salesman had preferred an appeal before the learned
Sessions Judge as Crl.Appeal No.290 of 1985. As per
judgment dated 31.3.1990, the said appeal was
dismissed and the findings of the learned Magistrate
was confirmed. Against the above finding, the 1*
accused had approached this Court by filing
Crl.Revision Petition No.386 of 1990. As per judgment
dated 18.9.1992, this Court held that the salesman
was entitled to the benefit of warranty and acquitted

the said accused. The said judgment has become
 2016KERI33670

(CALM.C.4855/2016 3

final.

4.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the
petitioner, who is arrayed as the 2 accused, was out
of country in connection with his employment. The
case against him was initially split up and re-filed as
276 of 1985. Thereafter it was transferred to the long
pending register and it is presently numbered as L.P.C.
No.86 of 2001. According to the learned counsel in
view of Annexure-B judgment of this Court, acquitting
the salesman of the shop, the proceedings against the
petitioner herein, who is the owner of the grocery shop
is nothing but an empty formality. It is further pointed
out that no purpose will be served by directing the
petitioner to undergo the ordeal of trial.

5.The learned counsel would also submit relying on the ratio
of the judgment of the Apex Court in Pepsico India

Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Food Inspector and another
 aovakeRaier

CHM.C485572016 4
[2010 (4) KLT 706 (SC)] and that of a Division Bench of
this Court in Rasheed N.K. V Food Inspector,
Thalasserry (2016 (1) KLD 704) to contend that Section
23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food
Adulteration Act are mandatory, and any prosecution
instituted under the Act, in violation of the said provisions
cannot be sustained. It is forcefully urged that method of
analysis is not a validated one as prescribed under S.23
(1A)(hh) and the laboratory where the analysis was
conducted was not a defined one for such examination
under S.23(1A)(ee) of the Act.

6.Heard the submissions of the learned counsel as well
as the Public Prosecutor.

7.It is discernible from Annexure-B judgment that the 1*
accused who was the salesman of the said shop room
was granted the benefit of warranty and was acquitted

by this Court. The petitioner being the owner of the
 ao1wKtnase7
CALM.C.4855/2016 s
grocery shop is entitled to avail the benefit of the said
finding as well.

8.More over, the Division Bench in Rasheed N.K. ( Supra),

after interpreting the various provisions of the PFA Act ,
1957, in line with the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
Pepsico Case (Supra), has held that in order for the
Analyst report to become the basis for launching a
prosecution, the analysis of the food has to be conducted
in a laboratory defined under S.23(1A)(ee) of the Act. In
the case on hand the report is dated 10.2.1983 which in
other words means that the laboratory where the analysis
was conducted could not have been a defined lab. If that
be the case the taking of cognizance on the basis of the
said report cannot be sustained. In the above facts and
circumstances, I am of the view that the continuation
of proceedings as against the petitioner is nothing but

an abuse of the process of law.
 (CALM.C.4855/2016 6

Accordingly, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings against the petitioner in L.P.C.No.86 of
2001 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate Court, Thalassery, will stand quashed.
