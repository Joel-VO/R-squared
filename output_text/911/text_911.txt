This case having been finally heard on today the court on the same day delivered the
following
JUDGMENT

1. This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Pettah Police Station in
 2
crime No. 981/2016 alleging commission of offences ws 323, 324, 294(b),
506(i) rw 34 of IPC. Cognizance is not taken for the offence punishable w/s
294(b) of IPC.

2. ‘The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to enmity towards CWI
and in furtherance of their common intention, on 07/08/2016 at 11 am, at the
byroad from Attuvarambu Road near Chackai YMA Hall, the accused came in
bike, shouted abusive terms at CW1 and criminally intimidated by
threatening to kill him. The 1 accused also hit CW1 with a helmet which was
a dangerous weapon when used as a weapon of offence, the 2™ accused also
fisted CW1 on his chest and face. The accused thereby committed the
‘offences as alleged against them,

3. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 appeared on summons and they were furnished with
copies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the
offences w/s 323, 324, 506(i) thw 34 of IPC_was framed and it was read over
‘and explained to them and they pleaded not guilty

4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 to CW3 as PW1 to PW3
and marked a document as Ext.P1, Since the witnesses examined did not
‘support the prosecution, CW4 to CW14 were given up by the learned APP.
Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating
circumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination ws 313
‘of CPC was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.

5. Heard both the sides.

6. The points that arise for consideration are:-

1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable w's 323,

324, 506(i) rw 34 of IPC, as alleged?
 Gm

3
2, What shall be the sentence or order?

7. Roint.No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 3 witnesses
and 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 is the sole injured in
this case. He affirmed the occurrence and admitted Ext.P1 FI Statement given
to police. He deposed that he could identify the assailants, but they were not
the accused herein, As per PW1, the names of the accused were stated upon
hearsay. PW2 and PW3 cited as occurence witnesses denied having
‘witnessed the alleged incident. Thus, all the material witnesses tured hostile
to prosecution. Therefore, the leamed Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the
remaining witnesses. From the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the
“occurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the
prosecution failed to prove that the accused committed the offences ws 323,
324, 506(i) rw 34 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution

8. Roint No.2::- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2
are found not guilty of the offences punishable ws 323, 324, 506(i) rw 34 of
IPC they are acquitted ws 248(1) of CPC and set at liberty, cancelling their
bail bonds.

Property produced in this case as T 473/2016 helmet, being valueless, shall be

destroyed. Property produced as T 448/2016 Motor Cycle bearing registration

No. KL-01-BD-5135 released on kychit is hereby made absolute.
