Cri. M. C. No. 8251 of 2017

Dated this the 4" day of January, 2018
ORDER

The petitioners are arrayed as the accused in S.C.
No.896/2012 of Additional Sessions Court 1, Alappuzha arising
from Crime No.274/2011 of Pattanakkadu Police Station for
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 149, 452, 323, 324,
354 & 427 of IPC and Sections 3(1)(v)(xi) of the Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It was
alleged by the prosecution that due to previous enmity, on
11.06.2011, the petitioners trespassed into the house of the de
facto complainant and attacked the de facto complainant and
others. Petitioners abused the de facto complainant by calling
caste name. Respondents 2 to 9 are the de facto complainant
and the injured persons. Accordingly, crime was registered. After
investigation final report was laid as Annexure Al

2. _Itis stated that the parties have resolved their disputes
among themselves amicably. Accordingly, Cri.M.C. is filed on a
Premise that the respondents do not have any objection in

quashing the criminal proceedings. To substantiate it, the
 2018KERASS
(Cr M,C. No, 8251 of 2017 2

petitioners have produced Annexures A2 to A9 affidavits affirmed

by the injured persons and the de facto complainant.

3. The learned Public Prosecutor on _ instructions
submitted that the parties have resolved their disputes. The
statement of the victims have been recorded. It is seen that
though 7 persons sustained injury, no dangerous weapon is seen
used. They are neighbours also. It is seen that the petitioners are
not involved in any other crime.

4. Having considered these facts, | feel that no purpose
will be served by prosecuting the petitioners and the dispute is
essentially in the nature of a private dispute between the parties.
Hence, | am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482
CrP.C. to give a quietus to the entire disputes.

Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed, All further proceedings in S.C.
No.896/2012 of Additional Sessions Court 1, Alappuzha stand
quashed.
