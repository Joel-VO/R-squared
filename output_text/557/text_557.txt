Cri. M. C. No. 6581 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of October, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the 1" accused in S.C. No.1075/2010
of 1* Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram,
who stands indicted for offences punishable under Sections 498A,
306 read with 34 of IPC. The matter is now pending before the 4”
Additional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram as S.C.
No.100/2014. The charge was read over on 20.09.2016 and
thereafter, the matter was scheduled for trial from 17.10.2016 to
19.10.2016.

2. The grievance of the petitioner herein is that, the
counsel for the petitioner is engaged in other pre-fixed matters
and hence he is not in a position to conduct the trial on those
dates. It was submitted that, the matter was brought to the
notice of the court below which was turned down and the court
proceeded to post the case on 17.10.2016. According to the
petitioner, he had engaged a lawyer about 4 years back and at
this stage change of the lawyer is not possible. Learned counsel

seeks appropriate reliefs invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C.

(Cri. M, C. No, 6581 of 2016

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

4, The grievance of the petitioner is based on the
inconvenience of the lawyer who is engaged in other trial fixed on
those dates. Essentially scheduling a matter by a trial court is
dependent on the pendency of cases, whether the case is ripe
and other priorities including the availability time. When the
court exercise that discretion it may not be proper on the part of
the High Court to exercise Section 482 Cr.P.C. to upset the
schedule.

5. Having regard to these, | am not inclined to interfere
with the schedule now fixed by the court below. However, if the
petitioner has a genuine grievance, he may move the court below
with an appropriate application based on the available records
establishing, the inconvenience, so that the court can evaluate
the available materials and pass a considered order.

Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
