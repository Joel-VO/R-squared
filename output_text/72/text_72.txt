(CrLM.CNo, 65 of 2024

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.207/2019 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam, registered for
the offences punishable under Sections 341, 294b and 506 of
Indian Penal Code, 1860.

2. Petitioner had initially been released on bail. — However,
thereafter he absconded and due to his failure to appear before
the Court, bail already granted, was cancelled and a non bailable
warrant has been issued apart from steps initiated under Section
82 and 83 of Cr.P.C.

3. Sri.Suresh B.S., the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the petitioner is willing to appear before the Trial court and
seek bail. However, he apprehend that he may be remanded to
custody before considering his bail application.

4, Stic

Hrithwik, the leamed Public Prosecutor, opposed the

contentions and submitted that the non bailable warrant issued to
the petitioner is to secure his presence before the trial court.

5. Since the petitioner has undertaken that he will appear before
the trial court without fail, I am of the view that an opportunity
‘ought to be granted to the petitioner.

6. Therefore, if the petitioner appears before the trial court on or
before 16.01.2024 and applies for recall of warrant and for grant
of bail, those applications shall be considered by the learned
Magistrate on the same day itself. To enable the petitioner to
appear before the learned Magistrate, coercive proceedings
pursuant to the non bailable warrant issued in C.C.No.207/2019
on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-,
Emakulam shall be kept in abeyance till 16.01.2024.

This Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
