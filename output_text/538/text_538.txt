Cri.M.C. No.6232 of 2016

Dated this the 3" day of October, 2016

ORDER

1.This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (for short 'Code') has been preferred by the
petitioners herein for quashing the proceedings pending
against them as C.P.No.38 of 2016 on the file of the
Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Koilandy. In the said
case, they stand indicted for offences punishable under
Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 506(2), 308, 427 read with
Section 34 of the IPC.

2.The prosecution allegation is that on 23.8.2015 at 8 a.m.,
while the de facto complainant was returning back in a
bike, the petitioners herein are alleged to have wrongfully
restrained him and after abusing him assaulted him with
their hands. It is further alleged that the 3" accused in
the aforesaid case had attempted to hit the de facto
complainant with an iron rod on his head and if he had not

evaded the blow, the accused would have been guilty of
 2016KERIA2227
CHLM.C.6232/2016 2

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,
the 3° respondent as well as the learned Public
Prosecutor.

4.It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the
3” respondent that the disputes have been amicably
resolved. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3 affidavit
sworn to by him wherein it is asserted that the dispute
does not subsist any more.

5.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits
that in view of the settlement arrived at between the
parties, this Court will be justified in quashing the
proceedings. According to the learned counsel, the only
allegation is that the 3° accused made an attempt to
strike the 3 respondent and the prosecution has no case
that any injury was sustained.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submits that
the 4 accused is involved in another case. However,

insofar as the other accused are concerned, no previous
 2016KERIA2227

antecedents are reported.

7.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another (2012
(10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position
in respect of the powers vested in the High Court under
S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal
proceedings. It was held that the power vested in the
High Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, is not limited to quashing proceedings within the
ambit and scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. The three - Judge Bench in the above case,
clearly expounded, that quashing of criminal proceedings
under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be
based on settlements between private parties, and could
also on a compromise between the offender and the
victim. Only that, the above power did not extend to
crimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention,
that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under
Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing

criminal proceedings, was held tobe exercisable in
 2016KERIA2227
CHLM.C.6232/2016 4

criminal cases having an overwhelming and
predominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising
from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership,
or such like transactions. Or even offences arising out of
matrimony relating to dowry etc. or family disputes where
the wrong is basically private or personal. In all such
cases, the parties should have resolved their entire

dispute by themselves, mutually. Further, guidelines were

issued by the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of
Punjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh
Kamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others
[AIR 2016 SC 2452].

8.1 have considered the rival submissions and I have gone

through the materials on record. The offence committed

by the p

ioners cannot be said to be grave and serious
having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also
does not appear that the offence in this case will have a
serious impact on the society. More over, when the party

respondents have settled the matter, the possibility of
 2016KERIA2227

conviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the
criminal case against the petitioners would be a futile
exercise. It would also put the petitioners and the party
respondents to great oppression and prejudice. Though
the 4 accused is said to be involved in another case as
well, taking note of the allegations in the instant case, I
am of the view that there is no reason to deny the prayer
sought for.

9.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of
the considered view that this Court will be well justified in
invoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of
the Code to quash the proceedings.
In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-
‘A2 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto

against the pet

ners now pending as C.P.No.38 of 2016
on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class,
Koilandy are quashed.
