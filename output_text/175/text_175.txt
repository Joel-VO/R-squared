BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Cri.M.C.No.189 of 2024

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioners are facing indictment for the offence under Sections 279,
341, 332, 356 and 294(b) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code,
11860, in C.C.No.262/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Chavakkad, which arose from Crime No.660/2019 of Chavakkad
Police Station. They challenge the final report filed in the above case.

2. According to the prosecution, the defacto complainant who is the
driver of a KSRTC bus was wrongfully restrained and assaulted by the
petitioners on 29.10.2019 and thereby committed the offences alleged.

3. Sri. A. G. Viswambharan, the learned counsel for the petitioners
contended that the prosecution allegations do not make out any of the
offences alleged and that the imputations against the petitioners are
highly improbable. It is also alleged that the allegations are manifestly
attended with malafides and therefore, the jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, can be invoked as
held in the decision in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1)
SCC 335]. Apart from the above, the learned counsel also asserted that
the complaint was initiated by the defacto complainant only for the

purpose of overcoming departmental action against him for his criminal

ate

behavior and the victims of the incident are being arrayed as accused.

4, Smt. Sreeja. V, the learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand
submitted that the nature of allegations as revealed from Annexure-AL
final report indicates that the same can be appreciated only after trial and
that Section 482 of CrP.C. cannot be invoked.

5. The prosecution alleges that, on 29.10.2019, the accused, who
were travelling in a car blocked the KSRTC bus driven by the defacto
complainant for not having given way for the car, Thereafter the accused
opened the diver’s door of the bus and assaulted the defacto complainant
and attempted to pulled him down after abusing him and thereby
committed the offences alleged. Though the leamed counsel for the
petitioner vehemently contended about the alleged falsity of the crime, 1
‘am of the view that, these are all matters for appreciation after due trial
and the jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrP.C. cannot be availed to
quash the proceedings. Further, if in case, the allegations raised against
the petitioners are not made out from the materials collected by the
investigation, petitioners will have to approach the jurisdictional
Magistrate seeking discharge. The inherent powers of this Court under
Section 482 of the CrP.C. cannot be invoked in a case of this nature.

Accordingly, | find no merit in the Criminal Miscellaneous Case and it
is dismissed.
