since it is reported that the presence of the material witnesses cannot be

had not been examined by the prosecution, On analysis of the evidence of
prosecution it can be seen that there is no direct evidence to prove that the
accused has committed the offence as alleged by the prosecution .Having
considered evidence on record, this court is of the view that prosecution has
failed to prove the guilt of the accused. For the said reason these points are

found against the prosecution.
