the accused No.2 is no more. Copy of death certificate of accused No.2 is

produced. Hence, charge against him is abated,

(On the side of prosecution, PW1 and PW2 were examined. As the material
‘witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the leamed Assistant Public
Prosecutor gave up the CW3 and CW4. In the absence of any incriminating
circumstances against the accused No.1 questioning of the accused No.1 under
section 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was dispensed with.

 405
Heard both sides and perued records.

‘The following pol i incateat
(1) Whether the accused no.1 lend Rs.1,00,000/- to CW1 on exorbitant interest

rate and obtained title deed and cheque leaf as security and thereby
committed the offence ws. 17 of Kerala Money Lenders Act, 1958?

(2) Whether the accused no.1 molested CW1 for recovery of loan amount and
thereby committed the offence w/s. 13 of Kerala Money Lenders Act, 1958?

@) If the accused No.1 is found guilty? What is the order as to sentence?

Point No.1 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point number 1 is considered
together. Prosecution case is that accused has committed offences punishable

under section ws. 13, 17 of Kerala Money Lenders Act, 1958.

PWI denied his statement before the police and deposed that she had not

preferred any complaint against the accused.

1. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and she

is justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of
prosecution. Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view

that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused No.1. For the said

reason this point is found against the prosecution.
 S ofS
11, Point No.2 := Upon the finding in point no.1 the Accused No.1 is found not

guilty of offences punishable under section 13, 17 of Kerala Money Lenders
Act, 1958 and she is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) Code
