Cel.MC.No.8881 OF 2019(a)

)RDER
Dated this the 9th day of January 2020

The petitioners are aggrieved by the
impugned order of the Special Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, at Annexure B,
wherein exercising jurisdiction under Section
14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security
Interest Act, 2002 (herein after referred to as
"the Act') on petition filed by the secured
creditor the respondent herein, appointing Paul
Varghese as Commissioner to take delivery of

the secured assets scheduled with the petition.

2. The petitioners are aggrieved for the
reason that Section 14 of the Act does not
empower the Chief Judicial Magistrate to
appoint an Advocate Commissioner to take
possession of the secured assets. The learned

counsel appearing for the petitioners reads out
 2020KERII2

Cel.MC.No.8881 OF 2019(a)

3

Section 14(1) 3* proviso, wherein it is stated
that, the District Magistrate or the Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate may authorize any
officer subordinate to him take possession of
such assets and documents relating thereto.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioners
submits that, an Advocate cannot be appointed
as a Commissioner since the Advocate is not an
officer subordinate to the Magistrate.

4. The learned counsel appearing for the
respondent drew the attention of this Court to
the decision Muhammed Ashraf v. Union of India
2008(4) KLT 1, wherein, the Division Bench of
this Court has held thus;

“With regard to the argument that a
Commissioner cannot be appointed by the
Chief Judicial Magistrate as part of
giving assistance in taking possession
of the secured assets while rendering
assistance to the secured creditor to
get possession of the secured assets, we
are of the view that it is not necessary
 220KERII22

Crl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019(a)

that the District Magistrate or the
chief Judicial Magistrate should go
personally and take possession. S.14(2)
of the Securitisation Act provides that
the Magistrate can order even police
assistance and use all necessary powers
in taking possession of the secured
assets.”

The Division Bench relied on the decision

of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sakiri Vasu

State of Uttar Pradesh 6 Ors. (2008(1)KLT
724 (SC)

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that what the Division Bench is
ordered, is that a Commission can be issued but
an Advocate Commission cannot be issued,
because an Advocate is not subordinate to the

Magistrate.

6. A reading of the Section clearly

indicates that, the Magistrate is authorized to
 2m20KER/II22

Cel.MC.No.8881 OF 2019(a)

5
appoint an officer subordinate to him to take
possession of the secured property. when an
Advocate is appointed as a Commissioner, he
becomes an officer of the court and subordinate

to the Magistrate.

A reading of the Section and the precedent
on the point would very clearly indicate that,
the Magistrate has power to appoint a
commissioner, and definitely an Advocate as a
Commissioner for identification of the secured
assets and taking possession of the secured
assets. The objection raised by the learned
counsel for the petitioner is puerile and

therefore sustainable.

The Crl.M.C is therefore dismissed.
