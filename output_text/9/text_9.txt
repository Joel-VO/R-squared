Cri.M.C..No. 9 OF 2015

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the original second accused in
C.C. No.161/2006 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Hosdurg. Of the ten accused in the case, seven faced trial in
C.C. No.161/2006 and obtained a judgment of acquittal when
the prosecution failed to procure the presence of the material
witnesses during trial. The case against the original accused
Nos.2,4 & 5 was split up and refiled as C.C. No.612/2008.
Later, the original accused No.5 also got acquittal in C.C.
No.612/2008 on 24/1/2011 when the material witness did not
support the prosecution. The case against the original accused
Nos. 2 & 4 was again split up and refiled. Later, the case
against the original 4" accused was quashed by this Court as
per the order dated 8/2/2013 in Cri.M.C. No.369/2013. Now,
the case against the petitioner is pending as C.C.
No.1587/2013. He also seeks orders quashing the
prosecution on the ground that he and the de fcto complainant

have come to terms amicably out of Court. The de facto

complainant C.P,Mahamood is the 2™ respondent in this
proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has
settled the whole dispute with the accused, and he has no
grievance or complaint. The offence involved in this case are
under Sections 143,147,148 & 324 read with Section 149 of

IPC. Since compositio

not possible, orders are sought under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All the other
accused in the crime stand acquitted. In such a situation,
continuance of the prosecution, as against the petitioner herein,
will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time
of the court. Nobody will support the prosecution if the case
goes to trial.

In the result, the Cri.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioner in C.C. No.1587/2013 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg, will stand quashed under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the
petitioner will stand released from the prosecution, and the bail
bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged
