ORDER
The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.1042 of 2004 on
the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Ernakulam, now pending as L.P.No.6 of 2011. He is the
accused in Crime No.597 of 2003 of Ernakulam Town North

Police Station, registered for the offences punishable under

Sections 294 b (ii), 323, 324, 354 and 457 of the Indian Penal
Code, on the allegation that the petitioner had committed
trespass upon the property of his erstwhile neighbour, one
Rajan and caused hurt to him and others.

2. In this petition, it is stated that the alleged incident
took place long back in 2003, while the petitioner was owner in
Possession of 2 cents of land at Pallath Road, Thammanam.
But, long back in 2008, the petitioner had sold the said

properties near to which the offences are said to have been

committed and moved to South Chittoor, which is about

CrLM.C. No.2488 of 2015

8 k.m., after purchasing the land and properties there. So, he
has never been served with any summons or notice in the
criminal case pending against him. But on 10.4.2015, a
warrant was brought to his house saying it is in a long pending
case. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the
offences alleged against him and the disputes have been
amicably settled between the petitioner and the de facto
complainant. The petitioner apprehends that since the
offences alleged include Sections 324, 354 and 284 (b) IPC
and it is a LP case, if he surrenders before the learned
Magistrate, he may be remanded to the judicial custody on the
ground that it is a long pending case. Hence the petitioner
sought for a direction to the court below to dispose of the
application for bail on the date of hearing itself.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the pé

joner.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a
direction on the ground that, since it is a long pending matter,

the petitioner may be remanded to jail, pending decision on
 201SKERA7260

CrLM.C. No.2488 of 2015

the application.

I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand an
accused mechanically without application of mind. However,
to secure the interest of justice, the learned Magistrate is
directed to pass orders on the application for bail to be filed by

the petitioner, on the date of appearance itself.
