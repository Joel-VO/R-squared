Crl.M.C. No.2116 of 2015

Dated this the 21" day of April, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioner is the fourth accused in NDPS
Crime No.2/2014 of Excise Range, Erattupetta. The
prosecution case is that the accused Nos.1 to 3 were
selling Ganja in an autorikshaw owned and possessed
by the petitioner and when the Excise party came, they
ran away. The respondent took custody of the vehicle
along with 50 grams of Ganja in it and thereafter the
vehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the
Erattupetta Police Station. The petitioner filed CMP
No.3511/2014 under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. for
getting interim custody of the vehicle. The
respondent objected the said application on the
allegation that the petitioner is a habitual offender
and if the autorikshaw is released to the petitioner he
will again commit the very same offence. The legality

and propriety of the findings whereby the court below
 201SKERA7ISE
CAM.C2116/15-8 2:

rejected the application under Section 451 of the
Cr.P.C, is under challenge in this Crl.M.C.

2. The learned counsel for the petitioner
advanced arguments challenging the findings whereby
the court below declined the grant of interim custody.

3. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor
advanced arguments to justify the denial of the
interim custody.

4. Going by the impugned order it is seen that the
application for interim custody was dismissed on the
sole reason that the petitioner is a habitual offender
involved in several crimes. But the particulars of the
said offences, in which he was allegedly involved, are
not stated in the impugned order. Indisputably, the
vehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the
police station in a position exposed to sunlight and
rain and the vehicle will be ruined, if it is allowed to
be kept as such. In the absence of the particulars of
the offences, in which the petitioner is said to have

involved, he cannot be treated as a habitual offender,
 201SKERA7ISE
CAM.C2116/15-8

who used the above said autorikshaw for the
commission of any other offence. In this analysis, I
am of the view that no purpose will be served by
keeping the autorikshaw in the police custody in a
way subject to speedy and natural decay. The said
view is supported by the decision of the Apex Court in
Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujrat [AIR (2002)
10 SC 290]. Therefore, I am inclined to grant interim
custody of the vehicle to the petitioner subject to
the following conditions:

(1) The petitioner shall furnish Bank Guarantee
for the value of the vehicle, which is to be
determined by the competent authority.

(2)The petitioner shall produce the vehicle
before the concerned Magistrate's court as
and when required,

(3)In the event of failure to produce the

vehicle, the court below is allowed to encash
the Bank Guarantee.

‘This petition is allowed.
