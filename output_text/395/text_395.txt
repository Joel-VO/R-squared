Crl.M.C.No.4267 of 2016
Dated this the 3" day of August, 2016
ORDER

The petitioner herein stands accused in Crime
No.417/2014 of Thiruvalla police station for offences
punishable under Sections 8 & 12 of the Protection of Children
from Sexual Offences Act,2012.

2. Considering the fact that the petitioner belongs to
West Bengal, he was granted bail by Annexure Al order dated
31/3/2014 subject to several conditions inter alia that he shall
execute a bond for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties
each. Thereafter, he approached this Court by filing
Cri.M.C.No.8031/2015 contending that the condition imposed
by that Court was too onerous and sought for relaxation of the
condition. By Annexure A2, this court modified the condition
No. 1 in Annexure Al with regard to one surety, inter alia, by
directing that any resident of Kerala be a relative or not, can
be accepted by the court, if that surety is solvent to the extent
of Rs. 3 Lakhs fixed by the trial court.

3. The petitioner herein has again approached this court

contending that even after the modified order passed by this
 2010KERI1876

CHLM.CNo 42672016
Court on 23/12/2015, still the petitioner could not find two
sureties who are willing to offer themselves as sureties for
the bond amount of Rs.3 Lakhs.

4, It is evident that in spite of a favourable order, the
petitioner herein could not obtain sureties for execution of
bond of Rs. 3 Lakhs. It seems that the above condition has
become unworkable as far as the petitioner herein is
concerned. Hence, I feel that a lenient view is liable to be
taken and the bond amount ordered to be executed by the
sureties is slashed down to Rs. One Lakhs each. All other
conditions will remain. In the event of the petitioner herein
again finding difficulty in executing a bond as above, the
court below shall expedite the trial having regard to the fact
that the petitioner herein is under trial.

Cri.M.C.is disposed of with the above directions.
