2. There are altogether seven accused. Four out of seven

were acquitted in C.C.No.489/ 2009 on the file of the same court.

Learned Judge acquitted four of them for want of any independent
evidence. It was held that none of the members of the public were
present in the scene of occurrence is fatal to the prosecution case
and that in the absence of any public in the public place, it cannot
be said that the accused have created obstruction or caused
annoyance to them by uttering filthy words.

In the facts and circumstances, no purpose will be served by
prosecuting the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C is allowed. All
further proceedings in Crime No.137/2009 of Pandikkad Police
Station pending as L.P.No.7/2013 in C.C.No.144/2012 on the file of
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna is quashed.
