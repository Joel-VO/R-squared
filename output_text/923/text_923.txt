This case having been finally heard on today the court on the same day delivered the

following :-
JUDGMENT
1. This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura Police

Station in crime No. 148/2016 alleging commission of offences w/s 447, 294(b),

'506(ii) and 323 of IPC, Cognizance is taken for the offences punishable u/s 447, 323,
 and 506(i) of IPC.

‘The prosecution case in brief is that the accused who was working as the
Manager at Future General Insurance, due to enmity towards CWI for
refusing to take insurance police, on 15/02/2016 at 11,30 am, criminally
trespassed into the courtyard of CW1’s house, that is, T:C. 42/4853,
Vaikundam House, shouted abusive words at CW1, caught hold on his dress
and pushed him down. The accused also criminally intimidated CW1 by
threatening to defame him. Thereby the accused committed the offences as
alleged against him
3. Accused appeared on summons and he was furnished with copies of all
relevant prosecution records. After hearing, particulars of the offences ws
447, 323 and 506(i) of IPC was framed and it was read over and explained to
him and he pleaded not guilty.
4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW2, CW3, CWS, CW7 and
‘CWB as PW1 to PWS respectively and marked documents as Ext.PI to PS. It
is reported that CW1 is not willing to appear before the court or to adduce
evidence. CW4 is reportedly abroad. CWS is given up by the prosecution.

Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no

ating,

circumstances brought out

evidence against accused, examination ws 313
‘of CrP.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.
5. Heard both the sides.
6. The points that arise for consideration are:-
1, Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable ws 447,

323 and 506i) of IPC, as alleged?
 3
2. What shall be the sentence or order?

7. Boint No.1_:= The evidence in this case consists of depositions of Switnesses
and 5 documents from the side of the prosecution, PW1 is the former wife of
CL. She deposed that she did not see the alleged incident and turned hostile
to prosecution. PW2 cited as occurrence witness denied having witnessed the
incident. PW3 who was the former driver of CW1 deposed that on 15/02/2017
at about 10.30 am a woman who was LIC agent came to the house of CWI
and thereafter a few men came there and created problems. As per PW3, the
issue arose for not taking insurance policy. PW3 deposed further that he did
not see any incident of assault and turned hostile to prosecution, PW4 was the
Sub Inspector of Police at Poojappura Police Station. He recorded Ext.P1 FI
Statement and registered ExtP2 FIR ws 143, 147, 149, 447, 294(b), 506(ii)
and 323 of IPC. Ext.P3 is the Scene Mahazar prepared by PW4. PWS took
‘over investigation of the case and filed Ext.P4 report deleting sections 143,
147 and 149 of IPC. Ext.P5 is the name and address report of the accused.
PWS completed investigation and filed final report against the accused.

8. From the above evidence, it is clear that the injured in the case is not
examined by prosecution. All the occurrence witnesses denied having
‘witnessed any incident as alleged. The remaining evidence is that of formal
and official witnesses. There is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged or
to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove
that the accused committed the offences ws 447, 323 and 506(i) of IPC. Point
No.1 is found against the prosecution,

9. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused is found not
 4
guilty of the offences ws 447, 323 and SO6(i) of IPC, he is acquitted ws
255(1) of Ce.PC and set at liberty, cancelling his bail bond.

Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected

and pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28° day of February 2025.
