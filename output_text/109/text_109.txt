CrI.M.C.No.93 of 2017

Dated this the 5° day of January, 2017
RDER

The dispute arises in relation to the Maruti WagonR
vehicle bearing registration No.KL-49G/2383, which was
subject matter of hire purchase agreement. It was seized
by the Kunnamkulam Police in Crime No.2593/2016 in a
complaint preferred by the petitioner herein against the
borrower. Pending the proceedings the registered owner
of the vehicle preferred Crl.M.C.7923/2016 along with his
mother seeking a stay of the entire proceedings. Stay for
a period of two months was granted by Annexure-2 order.
Subsequently by Annexure-3. —order_—in
Crl.M.C.No.8919/2016 it was clarified that the interim
stay granted by the court will not stand in the way of the
court below taking up Crl.M.P.7435/2016 in Crime
No.2593/2016 of Kunnamkulam Police Station, which was
an application filed by the RC owner seeking interim
custody of the vehicle.

2. The grievance of the petitioner herein who is
 201

CH1.M.C.No.93 of 2017 2

the financier is that, his application for interim custody is
not being taken for hearing on a premise that neither
‘Annexure-2 nor Annexure-3 authorised the court below to
take up his Crl.M.P.No.7525/2016. In the light of above,
it is clarified that the court below shall take up
Cri.MP.No.7525/2016 also along with
Cri.M.P,No.7435/2016 filed by the RC owner and dispose
of together.

Crl.M.C. is disposed of accordingly
