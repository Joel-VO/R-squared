THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE
FOLLOWING:

ORDER

Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.c.

2. The petitioner is the accused in CC No. 198 of
2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-I, Pala. He prays that the
learned magistrate be directed to dispose of
the case without further delay.

3. I have perused Annexure A copy of the
proceedings sheet of the trial court. The case
is ripe for trial. The learned magistrate has
already issued summons to CW1 to CW12. Having
regard to these facts, I am inclined to allow
the request of the petitioner.

In the result, this Crl.M.c. is allowed. The

learned magistrate is directed to dispose of

the case within six months from the date of
receipt or production of a copy of this order,

whichever is earlier.
