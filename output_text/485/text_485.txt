Cri.M.C.No.5487 of 2020

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2021

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.106 of 2018
registered at the Chirayinkeezhu Police Station for the offence
punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 & 427 r/w
149 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.1474 of 2018 of Judicial First
Class Magistrate-III, Attingal. The de facto complainants at
whose instance the crime was registered are respondents 2 and
3. Annexure E affidavit has been filed by the 2" respondent,
and Annexure F by the 3% respondent stating that the dispute
has been settled and that they have no subsisting grievance
against the petitioner.

2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on
instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal
antecedents.

3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,
nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed
by the respondents 2 and 3, the contents of which are submitted
to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is

settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter.

Under normal circumstances, piece-meal_quashing of
proceedings is not entertained by this court. As far as the
Instant case is concerned, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner submits that petitioner's employment is at stake,
unless and until the proceedings are quashed and certificate to
that effect produced before the authorities. Taking the special
circumstances and the fact that the allegation is only of an
offence under Section 324 IPC, having been committed by the
petitioner along with others, the prayer for quashing the

proceedings is being entertained. Moreover, in view of the

settlement, pos

ity of the criminal proceedings ending in
conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings
will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view
of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in
Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab ((2008) 4 SCC 582]
and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another ((2012) 10
SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought.

4. In the result, this Cri.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in
C.C.No.1474 of 2018 of Judicial First Class Magistrate-II1,
Attingal is quashed. Sd/-
