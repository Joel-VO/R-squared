Cri, M. C. No. 7811 of 2016

Dated this the 11" day of January, 2017
ORDER
The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime
No.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station for offences punishable
under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 294(b) read with
149 of IPC. It was alleged by the prosecution that, on 22.12.2012
at about 11.00 p.m., while the defacto complainant along with his
friend were proceeding along the road, the accused intercepted
and attacked them using soda bottles and sticks. Complaint was

laid and on the basis of it crime was registered and inve:

was conducted. The matter was taken cognizance and is
pending.

2. The petitioners have approached this Court contending
that the disputes between the parties have been resolved and
that the allegation against the petitioners herein have been
sorted out. Learned counsel for the 2” respondent, the defacto
complainant invited my attention to Annexure 3 affidavit filed by
him wherein he has stated that the matter has been settled and
he has no objection in quashing the proceedings.

3. The leamed Public Prosecutor on _ instructions

submitted that that dispute has been settled between the parties.

(Cri. M, C. No, 7811 of 2016

It is further pointed out by the learned Public Prosecutor that the
1* accused is involved in another crime under Sections 153A and
307 IPC and the 2% accused is involved in another proceeding
under Section 395 IPC, The other petitioners are not involved in
any other case.

4, _ It is evident that, antecedents of at least the 1* and 2"
accused are not very appreciable, Though this may dissuade the
court from not permitting to quash the proceeding, taking into
consideration the fact that the other petitioners are not involved
in any other crime and the allegations herein is also not very
serious, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to permit the
parties to have their disputes resolved to give an effect to the
settlement arrived at, on a belief that the petitioner herein will
mend their ways and will not get themselves involved in any other
future crime.

In the light of the above, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further
proceedings in Crime No.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station
stand quashed.
