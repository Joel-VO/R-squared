CrILM.C. No.7935 of 2017

Dated this the 7" day of December, 2017

ORDER

Annexure A2 order whereby the Chief Judicial
Magistrate's Court, Kottayam has transferred C.C.No.1899 of
2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,
Ettumannoor to the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I,
Pala is under challenge. Petitioners are the accused.

2. According to the petitioners, there was no necessity
for a transfer in the matter.

3. On perusing the records, it has come out that the de
facto complainant in the case had approached the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate with a request for transfer by
expressing his grievance that he was under threat and it was
not possible for him to appear before the court at Ettumanoor.
His further complaint was that the police at Ettumanoor was

also not aiding him for his safe appearance before the court at
 2017KERHIS6
CrLM.C. No.7935 of 2017

Ettumannoor.

5. Ina case of transfer, what has to be considered is
whether it is just and convenient to transfer the matter. When
the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate was satisfied that it was
just and convenient to transfer the case, the transfer was
ordered. Presently, there is absolutely nothing to nullify the
said order.

With the said direction, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.
