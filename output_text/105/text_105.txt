Cri.M.C. No.90 of 2024

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024
ORDER

Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash all proceedings against them.

2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C. No.395/2022 on the
files of the judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamangalam, arising
our of Crime No.383/2022 of Kunnamangalam Police Station, registered for
the offences under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 506 r/w Section 34 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860. Second Respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, on 13.01.2022, due to an enmity on
account of the defacto complainant preventing an attempt of raging, the
accused restrained the defacto complainant and assaulted him using a
stick and thereby committed the offences alleged.

4, Heard the leamed counsel for the petitioners and the learned
counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5, The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter
has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought
to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of

proceedings.

CC.M.C.No.90 of 2024

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC
303}, the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court
can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim
and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view
was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v, State of Punjab and
Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State
of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. I have perused Annexure-3 affidavit filed by the second

respondent, The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon

verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto
complainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter
has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no
impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the
proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in
C.C. No.395/2022 on the files of the judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Kunnamangalam, are quashed.

This Cri.M.C is allowed as above.
