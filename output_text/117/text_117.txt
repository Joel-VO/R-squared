Cri.M.C.No.100 of 2024

Dated this the 15* day of January 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in SC No.930/2019 before the Additional
Sessions Court-VIl, Ernakulam. A non-bailable warrant has been issued
against the petitioner, since he had failed to appear before the court. The
limited relief now sought for by the petitioner is for a direction to consider the
bail application and the application for recall of warrant on the same date
itself, as he apprehends that the learned Sessions judge may remand the
petitioner to custody.

2. After having heard Sri.Mohammed Aslam, learned Counsel for the
petitioner as well as the learned Standing Counsel for the respondent, | am of
the view that this Cri.M.C can be disposed of with a direction.

3. Since the petitioner has come down to India on 26.12.2023, and
has expressed his willingness to appear before the Court, there will be a
direction to the jurisdictional court/competent court to consider the

application for recall of warrant and for grant of bail, if any filed by the

petitioner on the same day itself, provided such applications are filed within
10 days from today.
Cri.M.C. is disposed of accordingly.
