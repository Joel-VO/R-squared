Crl.M.C.No. 153 of 2017

Dated this the 9" day of January, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in
C.C.No.1787/2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,
Vatakara for offences punishable under Sections 279 and 304 A of
the Indian penal Code. The prosecution alleged that, the accused
herein, drove his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner on
15.10.2014 at 10.a.m., in such a manner as to endanger the life
of the people, hit against a person, who was thrown off, had
allegedly sustained injuries and later succumbed. After
investigation, final report was laid.

2. Contending that his vehicle had not sustained any
damage, that his vehicle had not hit the victim and that he has
been falsely implicated, the petitioner has sought to quash the
entire proceedings.

3. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

3. The prosecution is essentially relying on the
 2017KERDT

CAMC.No, 153 of 2017 2

postmortem report which indicates that the victim died due to the
injury sustained to his head. Eye witnesses have been arrayed to
substantiate the allegation that, they have seen the incident and
that the vehicle was driven by the petitioner herein in a rash and
negligent manner. Hence, it is clear that the question whether he
was driving the vehicle, whether it was rashly and negligently
driven and that he had caused the death of the person are all
matters which are in the realms of appreciation of evidence. I do
not feel that this is a matter which can be challenged in a
proceeding under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

‘The Crl.M.C. fails and is dismissed accordingly.
