RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V, J

Cri.M.C. No.4441 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of August, 2016
ORDER

1.The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.907 of 2015
on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I,
Kozhikode. He has been charged for having committed
offence punishable under sections 3, 4 read with section
17 of the Money Lenders Act and also under section 3 read
with section 4 of Exorbitant Interest Act. The respondents
2 to 9 are the victims.

2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the
Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.
State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of
other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v.
State of Punjab and anr. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and
Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand
 2016KERII23

CALM.C.4441/2016 2

(2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above
proceeding.

3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above
judgments have delineated the circumstances and the
cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be
invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the
purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed
that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings.

4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of
court settlement and there is no acrimony between them
at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved
and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The
respondents 2 to 9 have filed separate affidavits wherein
they assert that they have no objection in terminating the
proceedings.

5.The gist of the allegation is that the petitioner in course of
 2016KERII23
CALM.C.4441/2016 3

the illegal money lending activity conducted by him had
obtained valuable securities and other documents from
respondents 2 to 9 in this petition. It is submitted by the
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the
petitioner was conducting a valid money lending business,
as evidenced by Annexure-I. It is also submitted that the
matter has been amicably settled between the petitioner
and the party respondents.

6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits
that no other cases of heinous nature are reported against
the petitioner.

7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made across the bar and I have also gone through the
materials on record,

8.The respondents 2 to 9 have sworn to separate affiday

in which they assert that they have no objection in
allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as

all the disputes between the parties have been resolved
 2016KERII23
CALM.C.4441/2016 4

and the parties are living in peace and harmony.

9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in
nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is
also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of
compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as

the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to

continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility
of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in
putting the de facto complainant and the accused to
unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur
well for the interest of the community and will enable the
parties to live in peace and harmony.

10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in
quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case
falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex
Court in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases referred
to above.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
 2016KERII23

CALM.C.4441/2016 5

proceedings against the petitioner, who is the sole
accused in C.C.No.907 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial
Magistrate of First Class Court-I, Kozhikode, shall stand

quashed.
