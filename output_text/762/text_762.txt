‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION OW
08.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 ORDER
Dated this the 8th day of January 2020

The petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order
of the Additional Sessions Court-II, Mavelikkara in
Crl.M.P.No.512/2019 in $.C.No.503/2019, wherein he is
the 2" accused and sought for return of his Passport,
which was surrendered before the committal court in
pursuance of the conditions in the bail order. The
learned Sessions Judge in the impugned order stated
that the Passport cannot be returned because the
petitioner is only intending to apply for a Visa for
going abroad in search for job which does not appear
to be compelling on facts in view of the fact that he
has not secured a job abroad yet, therefore the
prayer for release of the Passport cannot be allowed.

The petitioner is a Diploma holder in Electrical
Engineering and wants to apply for a job abroad, for
which he has to apply for Visa. It is common
knowledge that without a Passport and Visa, he will

not be able to go abroad. For applying for a job, he
 has to produce his Passport and also to apply for
Visa, the Passport is essential. The case is of the
year 2019. There is no possibility of it being taken
up immediately. The petitioner does not have any
other criminal antecedents.

Under the above circumstances, I am inclined to
allow this Crl.M.c. and the Passport of the
petitioner shall be released to him for applying for
a job and Visa, after retraining a certified copy of
the Passport. However, it is made clear that before
going abroad, the petitioner shall again seek
permission of the Court below and it is only subject
to the such permission that he shall be allowed to go
abroad.
