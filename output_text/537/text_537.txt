‘SUNIL THOMAS, J.
Cri. M. C, Nos. 6201 of 2016 & 1192 of 2014
Dated this the 3” day of October, 2016
ORDER

These applications are filed by the complainant in CC
No.590/2010 and 480/2011 of the Judicial 1* Class Magistrate
Court, Kunnamkulam. CC No.480/2011 arises from Crime
No.119/1990 of Vadakkekad Police Station and Cri.M.C. No.
1192/2014 relates to that crime. The grievance of the petitioner
in CrLM.C. No.6201/2016 is that, the disposal of the cases is
getting delayed. According to the petitioner, while the trial in CC
No. 590/2010 had reached its fag end, the 5" respondent herein
filed an application for simultaneous trial along with CC
No.480/2011. It was allowed by Annexure-IX order. The
petitioner apprehends that, it will further delay the proceedings.

2. The learned Magistrate on a direction from this Court
has informed, by communication dated 27.09.2016 that, C.C.
Nos.590/2010 and 480/201 are being proceeded with and both
the cases can be disposed of within a period of 6 months time.

Having regard to this, | feel that, the request made by the
learned Magistrate is reasonable. Hence, | am inclined to dispose

of both the Crl.M.Cs. with a direction that, the court below shall

Cri. M, C. Nos. 6201 of 2016 & 1192 of 2014

dispose of the matters, at the earliest, as expeditiously as
possible, at any rate, within a period of 6 months from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order.

Crl.M.Cs. are disposed of.
