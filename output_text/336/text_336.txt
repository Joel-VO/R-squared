ORDER

The petitioner is the 4” accused in Crime No.614 of 2013 of
Aranmula Police Station, which is now pending as C.P.No.11 of 2015
on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1,
Pathanamthitta, The offence alleged against the petitioner is
punishable under Section 8(1) and (2) of the Abkari Act. The
grievance of the petitioner is that, the Magistrate Court has already
issued non-bailable warrant against him and if he surrenders before
the Magistrate Court there is every likelihood of the application not
being considered on the very same day. Therefore, the petitioner
seeks a direction to consider his bail application on the day of
surrender itself.

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor.

3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this
Cri.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioner to surrender before

the Magistrate Court within a period of two weeks from today and
 201SKERIITASS
(CrLM.C.No.2628 of 2015

the Magistrate Court is further directed to consider his bail
application on the day of surrender itself, strictly in accordance with
law. The non-bailable warrant already issued against the petitioner
shall be kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks.

‘The Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.

ANIL K.NARENDRAN, JUDGE
