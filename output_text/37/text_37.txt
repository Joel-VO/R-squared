Cri.M.C.No.26 of 2014

Dated this the 2"! day of January, 2014
ORDER

Petitioner is the 3% accused in Crime No.493/2009 of
Vadanappilly Police Station pending as L.P.No.70/2013. in
C.C.No.1117/2012 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Chavakkad. The offences alleged are punishable under
Sections 341, 323, 324, 452, 427 read with Section 34 of IPC.

2. There are altogether three accused in the case. Accused
Nos.1 and 2 faced trial and were acquitted in C.C.No.1269/2009.
A copy of the judgment dated 29.09.2012 is produced as
‘Annexure A2. The learned Magistrate found that the material
witnesses failed to support the prosecution case about the
involvement of the accused in the occurrence. The learned
Prosecutor has justifiably given up the remaining witnesses. The
court therefore found that, the prosecution failed to prove the
guilty of the accused persons and they were found not guilty.

In the facts and circumstances, no purpose will be served by
prosecuting the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C is allowed. All
further proceedings in Crime No.493/2009 of Vadanappilly Police
Station pending as L.P.No.70/2013 in C.C.No.1117/2012 on the
file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad is quashed.
