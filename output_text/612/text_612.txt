“Cri-M.C.No.7487 of 2017

Dated this the 06" day of December, 2017

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in
S.C.No.186/2013 of Additional District and Sessions
Court-, Thalassery, for offence punishable under Section
376 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that the
petitioner herein, who got acquainted with the first
respondent/de facto complainant sometime in the year
2010, offered to marry her and on the basis of the
promise to marry, had physical relationship with her at
various places. Thereafter, he retracted from the promise
and consequently, the first respondent laid a complaint,
alleging offence punishable under Section 376 of the

Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was
 20177KERA9300

CH.M.C.N0.7487 of 2017 2
laid and the matter is now pending as S.C.No.186/2013 of
Additional District and Sessions Court-I, Thalassery. The
petitioner has approached this Court, contending that
they got married on 05.05.2014 under the Special
Marriage Act and that hence, the parties do not intend to
prosecute the matter any further. To substantiate it, the
learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
counsel for the respondents relied on Annexure B
affidavit affirmed by the first respondent, reiterating the
settlement.

3. Since the allegations are serious and that it
involves an offence punishable under Section 376 of the
IPC, the learned counsel for the petitioner was directed
to advance arguments on merits. The learned counsel for
the petitioner contended that, even in the complaint,
there is no specific allegation that the petitioner herein
had made a false promise. It was stated by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that both parties had physical

relationship at various hotels which militates against the
 20177KERA9300

Cr.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 3
allegation of forceful rape. It was contended that it can
only be considered as a physical relationship between
two persons who were in deep love. To substantiate it,
the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the
decisions reported in Deelip Singh Alias Dilip Kumar
Vs. State of Bihar [(2005) 1 Supreme Court Cases
88], Uday Vs. State of Karnataka [(2003) 4 Supreme
Court Cases 46] and Kaini Rajan Vs. State of Kerala
[(2013) 9 Supreme Court Cases 113]. It was
contended that in the light of the above decisions, the
very basis that there was a false promise to marry cannot
survive. It was also contended that, this is reinforced by
the subsequent marriage between the parties and even
assuming that there was any false promise by the
petitioner herein, that stands condoned by the
subsequent conduct of the parties, It was further
contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
the allegation of false promise cannot also survive based

on the fact that they started courting each other in the
 20177KERA9300

CH.M.C.N0.7487 of 2017 4
year 2010. But, the first instance of physical relationship
was allegedly in the year 2012. This also militates
against the allegation of false promise.

4. Evidently, the complaint do not disclose a
specific allegation that at the time of the initial promise,
the petitioner herein had a mala fide intention. This is

reinforced by their subsequent marriage. The learned
Public Prosecutor also submitted that the matter has
been settled between the parties and a copy of the
marriage certificate was produced in open court.

5. Having considered these facts, I am inclined to
hold that prosecution under Section 376 is difficult to
survive. After having entered into the matrimonial
relationship, it cannot be expected that the first
respondent herein will stand by her allegations in the FIS
at the time of trial. Evidently, the prosecution can only be
a futile exercise. Hence, I am inclined to invoke the
jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC. to quash the

entire proceedings.
