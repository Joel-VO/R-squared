THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION
ON 03.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE
FOLLOWING:
 209K ERNS6

io

ba

The petitioner is accused No.2 in
C.C. No.110/2018 on the files of the court
below. The petitioner filed CMP No.1757/2018
before the court below, praying for
releasing the passport to the petitioner,
which was produced by the petitioner before
the court below at the time of executing the
bail bond. The court below as per
Annexure-IT order dismissed the said
petition, against which this Crl.M.c. has
been filed.

2. Heard.

3. It was observed in Annexure-II order

by the learned Magistrate that the
 209K ERNS6

petitioner did not state about the place
where he would propose to go. The
petitioner only stated that he is going
abroad for higher studies. However, there
was no mention in the petition about the
course for which he would propose to make
higher studies. The name of the University
to which he proposes to join for higher
studies was also not mentioned in the
petition. In view of the above reasons,
the court below rightly dismissed
CMP No.1757/2018. Having gone through the
order impugned, I do not find anything to
interfere with Annexure-II order.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands

dismissed.
 209K ERNS6

However, the petitioner shall be at
liberty to file fresh petition before the
court below, stating all the details
mentioned above and the document/ documents
to support the same. If the petitioner
files any such petition before the court
below, the court below shall consider and
dispose of the said petition in accordance

with law as expeditiously as possible.
