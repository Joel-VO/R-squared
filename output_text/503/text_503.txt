V.G.ARUN, J.

CRL.M.C.No. 5684 of 2020

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2021
ORDER

Petitioner is the 2 accused in S.T.No. 25 of 2017 and connected
‘cases pending before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II, Tirur. The
cases originated from complaints filed by the 1* respondent against the
petitioner and another, alleging commission of the offence under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the complaint itis alleged that the
petitioner, in his capacity as a Director of the 1" accused Company, had
entered into an agreement with the complainant Company for supply of
cement to the concrete mixing unit of the 1° accused Company. The
‘cement was supplied as per the agreement, but the accused failed to pay
the price of the cement and the commission agreed upon. The dispute was
later resolved and an agreement entered into between the complainant, in

terms of which the petitioner acknowledged the liat

ity and issued four
cheques towards its discharge. The cheques were dishonoured on
presentation due to insufficiency of funds in the accused's account.
Thereupon statutory notices, demanding payment of the amount was
issued, which also failed to evoke any response and hence complaints

were filed. Since the cheques pertained to a common liability between the
 cet.mc. 5686/2020 a 2n2UKERIE

‘same parties, the court ordered joint trial. During the course of such trial,
the petitioner filed an application seeking to send the cheques for expert
‘opinion regarding the entries therein. The said application stands rejected

by Annexure A1 order and hence this Cri.M.C.

2. The application seeking expert opinion was filed on the premise
that, during his cross examination, the complainant had testified that,
except the amount in figures and the date, all other entries in the cheque
were in his handwriting and that,the amount in figures and the date was
written by the petitioner. It is for disproving this fact and thereby
establishing the falsity of the case set up by the complainant that the
request was made to send the cheques for expert opinion.

3. The first respondent filed objection contending that the attempt is
only to protract the proceedings and that, no dispute having been raised
regarding the other entries in the cheque, including the amount entered in
words and the signature, no purpose would be served by obtaining expert
opinion regarding the date and the amount in figures.

4, The leamed Magistrate accepted the objection raised by the first
respondent and dismissed the application finding that, obtaining
handwriting experts opinion would in no way help the court to arrive at a
just decision in the case.

5. Sri, N.K.Mohanlal, learned Counsel for the petitioner, assailed the
 cet.mc. 5686/2020 ‘ 2n2UKERIE

findings in the impugned order, contending that, by dismissing the
application the lower court had prevented the petitioner from letting in best
evidence. It is contended that the expert opinion would have aided the
petitioner in setting up rebuttal evidence.

6. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the petitioner had
executed Exhibit P14 agreement acknowledging the liability and had
entered the particulars of the cheques issued towards discharge of the
liability in that document. The petitioner has not disputed his signature in
the agreement. Further, the petitioner has not disputed his signature in the
cheques or the amount entered in words. Therefore, as rightly found by the
learned Magistrate, no purpose would be served by sending the cheques
for expert opinion, other than delaying the trial unnecessarily.

In the result, the Cri. M. C. Is dismissed.
