MARY JOSEPH,

CrILM.C. No.5183 of 2014

Dated this the 08" day of December, 2017

ORDER

This is a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to
quash the FIR registered as Crime No.876/2014, a copy of which

is appended with this petition as Annexure Al.

The petitioner is the first accused in Crime
No.876/2014. Respondent No.2 has been entrusted with the
task of investigation of a case based on Crime No.876/2014. A
crime was registered initially, for the offences punishable under
Sections 354, 376(1), 376(2)(e) of the Indian Penal Code. The
first informant was one SmtSheeja. The allegations were
levelled by her against one Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan that he has
committed the offences punishable under Sections 354, 376(1),
376(2\(e) of the Indian Penal Code, against her.

3. Investigation was proceeded with in Crime No.876/2014
as_ registered originally by the Thrissur Town East Police Station
The investigating officer had arrived at a finding that the

allegations levelled by Smt.Sheeja, the defacto complainant in the
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

FS, which formed the basis for the registration of the FIR are
false ones. Accordingly, a report as Annexure A2 was filed by
respondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C. before the Judicial
First. Class Magistrate Court No.1, Thrissur. The report
incorporates the revelation of the investigating officer from the
investigation conducted by him that the petitioner and another
accused have caused the defacto complainant to give a false FIS
against DrSuresh Ezhuthachan, R/O.Aswani Hospital, Thrissur,
before respondent No.2 and thereby got the crime in question
registered against him. Accordingly, a report was filed before the
Judicial First Class Court No.1, Thrissur under Section 167 Cr.P.C
for removing the offences originally incorporated in Annexure Al
and to obtain permission to continue investigation by
incorporating offences punishable under Sections 195, 109 read
with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for short IPC) and
117(d) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 (for short ‘the Act, 2011")
against the petitioner and another accused.

4, Agarieved by the action of respondent No.2 that the first

accused has approached this Court in the captioned proceedings
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

seeking to quash the same. The allegations raised against the
petitioner was that he had instigated the defacto complainant to
give false evidence with an intention to procure conviction of
DrSuresh Ezhuthachan for offences liable to be punished with
imprisonment for life or imprisonment.

5. SriAnoop C.C., the learned counsel, advanced
arguments on behalf of the petitioner. Vide order of this court
dated 8.12.2017 in Crl.M.A. No.1399/2016, the de facto
complainant was brought on record in the proceedings on hand.

6. Sri.Manu, the learned counsel, representing the de
facto complainant, Smt.Rehna N.S., the learned Public Prosecutor
representing respondents 1 to 3 were heard elaborately on their
rival contentions.

7. SriAnoop C.C., the learned counsel for the petitioner
has submitted that a report under Section 167 Cr.P.C was filed by
respondent No.2 proposing to conduct investigation against the
petitioner as accused No.1 so as to prosecute him for the
commission of offences punishable under Sections 195, 109 read

with Section 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011 without any
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

basis. According to him, the action of respondent No.2 can only
be treated as sheer abuse of the authority. The contention
secondly advanced by the learned counsel was that a person is
said to give false evidence under Section 191 IPC only when he
makes any statement, which is false, which he either knows or
believes to be false or does not believe to be true, when he is
legally bound by an oath or by an expressed provision of law to
state the truth or being bound by law to make a declaration upon
any subject. According to the learned counsel, falsity of
allegations in the first information statement cannot be the basis
for launching a prosecution against the petitioner for the offence
under Section 191 IPC. The learned counsel placed reliance on
Vittappan_v, State [1987 (2) KLT, 174] to rest the above
contention. The contention thirdly advanced was that the
ingredients constituting the offence under Section 109 IPC are
not attracted from the allegations. The contention fourthly
advanced by the learned counsel was that the offence under
Section 117 (d) of the Act, 2011, also will not be attracted, in the

absence of any allegation having been made by respondent No.2
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

that the petitioner had given any statement before a Police
Officer.

8. Raising contentions as above, the learned counsel
canvassed for quashing the FIR appended with this proceedings on
hand as Annexure Al.

9. SriS.Manu, the learned counsel appearing for the de
facto complainant has submitted that the allegations in Annexure
Al FIR would satisfactorily meet with the ingredients constituting
the offences as described under Sections 195, 109 read with
Section 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011. According to him,
based on the First Information Statement of Mrs.Sheeja before
respondent No.2 that the Annexure Al crime was originally
registered and the investigation was pursued with and when that
culminated in a. finding that the allegations levelled in the FIS are
false ones, a report under Section 167 Cr.P.C was filed before the
court by respondent No.2. It was revealed to respondent No.2
during the course of investigation that Smt.Sheeja was made to
lodge the FIS containing false allegations against Dr.Suresh

Ezhuthachan as instructed by the petitioner herein and the other
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

accused, with a view to procure a false prosecution for grave
offences liable to be punished with imprisonment for life or
imprisonment. It was in the said circumstances that respondent
No.2 proposed to launch a prosecution against the petitioner and
the other accused for the offences as aforesaid. It is contended
by the learned counsel that circumstances being so, interference
of this Court is absolutely unwarranted in the matter.

10. The learned Public Prosecutor has attacked the
averments put forth by the learned counsel for the petitioner with
contentions similar to those raised by the counsel for the defacto
complainant.

11, In the said backdrop, this Court ventured to see
whether the arguments of the petitioner hold merits. As already
stated, the offences newly incorporated and in respect of which
the prosecution is proposed to be launched against the petitioner
and the co-accused are those punishable under Sections 195,
109, read with 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011

12. For an offence under Section 195 IPC to be attracted,

the person against whom allegations are raised, must have given
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

false evidence before a court of law. In the case on hand, the FIS
was lodged by Smt. Sheeja and that formed the very basis for the
registration of crime No.876/2014, which is Annexure A1 in the
case on hand. As already stated Annexure Al was originally
registered for the offences under Sections 354, 376(1), 376(2Xe)
of the IPC based on the First Information Statement lodged by
SmtSheeja. The respondent No.2 has conducted investigation in
the case and it was exposed to him during the course of
investigation that SmtSheeja has given a false statement and the
same was given at the instigation of two persons, one among
whom is the petitioner herein. Accordingly, a report was filed
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Thrissur for
removing Sections 354, 376(1) and 376(2)(e) IPC. An investigation
was also proposed to be conducted with the petitioner as the first
accused and another person as the second accused against the
commission of the offences punishable under Sections 195, 109
read with Section 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011
Prosecution was not proposed against SmtSheeja. It was

‘SmtSheeja, who lodged the FIS which subsequently turned to be
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

a false one. The allegation raised against the petitioners in the
proposed prosecution for the pursuit of which permission for
investigation under Section 167 Cr.P.C was sought was that the
petitioner and the co-accused instigated Smt.Sheeja to lodge the
FIS containing false allegations against Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan
liable to procure punishment of imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for him

13, In this connection it is pertinent to note that whether
the petitioner had given false evidence or fabricated false
evidence before a court of law, so as to attract the offence under

Section 195 IPC against him. Section 195 IPC reads as follows :

“195. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to
procure conviction of offence punishable with
Imprisonment for life or imprisonment. Whoever gives or
fabricates false evidence intending thereby to cause, or
knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person
to be convicted of an offence which by the law for the time
being in force in India is not capital, but punishable with
‘imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term of seven
years or upwards, shall be punished as a person convicted
of that offence would be liable to be punished.”
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

Section 195 IPC postulates two ingredients viz., giving false
evidence and fabricating false evidence. Section 191 provides for
the salient features of the offence of giving false evidence and it
comprises three essential features as mentioned hereinbelow:

1) legal obligation to state the truth

2) Making of a false statement

3) belief in its falsity.

Section 192 provides for the salient features of fabricating
false evidence and it comprises five essential features as noted
hereinbelow:

i) There must be causing of any circumstances to exist or
making any false entry in any book or record or making any
document containing a false statement.

It must be with the intention that it may appear in

evidence.

iii) Such evidence must be before a judge; arbitrator or public
servant.

iv) That it may cause him to entertain an erroneous opinion.

v) upon any material point.

14, From the allegations incorporated by respondent No.2 in
his report filed under Section 167 Cr.P.C, the ingredients of the
offences alleged are not made out. There is total want of
allegation either to the effect that the petitioner had given false
evidence before a court of law or that he had instigated
SmtSheeja to give evidence before a court of law. The allegation
would not also include that the petitioner had fabricated false
evidence or instigated SmtSheeja to fabricate false evidence and
adduce the same before a court of law. The allegation would only
disclose that the petitioner along with the other accused had
instigated Smt.Sheeja to lodge an FIS containing false allegations
against Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan before respondent No.2, who is
none other than a police officer.

14, Itt has been held by the Apex Court in Shambhu Das @
Bijoy Das & Anr.v. State of Assam [AIR 2010 SC 3300] that an FIR
under Section 154 Cr.P.C is not a substantive piece of evidence
and its use is only to contradict or corroborate with the statement
given by the First Informant himself at a later point of time. In

order to be qualified to be FIR, there must be something in the
 CHM No, 5183 of 2014 2URERIC

“lle
nature of a complaint or accusation or at least some information
of the crime given with the object of setting the police or criminal
law in motion. It must contain some information about the crime
committed as also some information about the manner in which
the cognizable offence has been committed.

15. The Apex Court has also held in Ramprasad v. State
of Maharastra [AIR 1999 SC 1969] that statement of witnesses
before the investigating officer cannot be used as evidence. It is
only that part of the statement, if duly proved, may be used by
the accused and with the permission of the Court by the
prosecution to contradict the witnesses concerned in the manner
provided by Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act.

16. In Vittappan’s case (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioner, a Single Bench of this Court had
occasion to consider whether a First Information Statement
containing false allegation would form basis for prosecution
under Section 191 IPC and held in the negative as follows:

“te is said that the complaint was thereafter filed on
the allegation that either the statements in Ext.PI or
those as PWI must be false and therefore the
appellant must be proceeded against. Ext.P1 cannot
‘satisfy the requirements of $.191 of the Indian Penal
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014

17.

ol

Code even if some of the statements contained
therein are proved to be false to the knowledge or
belief of the appellant or that he did not believe them
to be true. While giving Ext.P! Pw.1 was not legally
bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to
‘state the truth and he was also not bound by law to
‘make a declaration upon any subject. It is only an
information given under S.154 of the Code regarding
commission of a cognizable offence intended to set
the law in motion. Though the maker has to sign the
statement which is recorded, the Section does not
even say that the statement should be true to the
maker's knowledge or belief or that it should be given
‘on oath. Even a telephone information regarding
commission of a cognizable offence by unknown
persons could form first information under $.154. In
contra-distinction with $.154, the statement given
under $.161, though not to be signed by the maker,
must be true because S.161(2) says “shall be bound to
answer truly” First information statement is only the
information on which the concerned police officer has
to start the investigation to find out the truth and
collect the materials. It can be given no hearsay
information also. A wrong first information purposely
‘made for initiating action may be of consequence
under some other provision for example in an action
for malicious prosecution, but it is not penal under
'$.193 on the basis of S.191. Therefore the falsity of
‘any statement in Ext.P1 cannot be the basis of
prosecution. The Sessions Judge was not able to
come to the conclusion whether the falsity was in
Ext.PI or in the evidence given as Pw.1. The basis of
the conclusion is only the discrepancies between
Ext.P] and the evidence as Pw.!. Going by the
reasoning of the Sessions Judge the falsity can be in
Ext.PI itself and if so the evidence as Pw.1 can be true
‘also. In that event also there is no question of
prosecution under $.193."

2017KERIIT

In the case on hand, the allegations in the report filed by

respondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C are insufficient to

attract the offence under Section 195 IPC against the petitioner
 CHM No, 5183 of 2014 2URERIC

Be
for the aforesaid reasons. It is not revealed from the report that
the petitioner had given any false evidence or fabricated false
evidence to adduce before a court of law. It is also not revealed
from the allegations that the petitioner along with the other
accused had instigated the lady to give false evidence or fabricate
false evidence to adduce before a court of law. As already stated,
by lodging a false FIS, a person cannot be said to have given
false evidence before a court of law or fabricated false evidence
as contemplated by the provision. Similarly, a person cannot be
said to have instigated another to give false evidence before a
court of law or fabricate evidence even if it turns out later that
the former was behind the lodging of the false FIS by the latter.

18. Before adverting to the sustainability of the offence
under Section 109 IPC based on the allegations of respondent No.2
it is apposite to extract the provision hereunder:

“109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is
committed in consequence and where no express
provision is made for its punishment:~ Whoever abets any
offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is
made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment,
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

ol

be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation-An act or offence is said to be committed
in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in
consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the
conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment”.

Therefore, it is mandatory that for an offence of abetment
tobe attracted, the Act abetted must be committed in
consequence of the abetment. When viewed in this backdrop, it

is relevant to notice that the Act alleged as abetted,

ing
false evidence before a court of law or fabricating false evidence
to adduce before a court of law under Section 195 IPC, was not
allegedly committed. Even if, it is taken for granted that
SmtSheeja was compelled to give the First Information Statement
containing false allegations against Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan on
the instigation of the petitioner and another, that would not be
sufficient to attract the offence under Section 195 IPC for the
reason that the statement lodged by her as FIS is not evidence
and it was not tendered before a court of law.

19, Yet another ingredient to attract the offence of giving

false evidence was that the person making it would be legally
 CHLM.C No, $183 of 2014 2017 KERAITO

oS
bound to make the same. Therefore, if the person making it
does not have any legal obligation to give the truth in evidence,
he cannot be made liable for a prosecution for giving false
evidence. In the case on hand, the petitioner as well as the other
accused were not under any legal obligation to tender any
evidence nor to abstain from adducing any evidence. Smt.Sheeja,
who according to the prosecution, was the person allegedly given
the false FIS, was also not under any legal obligation as
contemplated by Section 195 IPC while lodging the FIS. In the
aforesaid circumstances the petitioner is not liable to be
prosecuted for the alleged action of instigating Smt.Sheeja to give
false evidence under Section 109 r/w Section 195 IPC. The action
of respondent No.2 proposing to conduct investigation against
the petitioner for the offences under Section 109 r/w Section 195
IPC so as to prosecute him would not legally sustain.

20. The further aspect to be looked into is the
attractability of the offence under Section 117(d) of the Act, 2011
based on the allegations set forth in the report filed by

respondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C. It is relevant to have

21. When viewed in the backdrop of the allegations set
forth in the report of respondent No.2, there is nothing to

disclose that a false statement has been given by the p

joner
deliberately to a police officer with intend to mislead the police in
material particulars relating to a police investigation or due
performance of police duty. Therefore, there is nothing in the
report filed by respondent No.2 liable to attract an offence under
Section 117(d) of the Act, 2011.

22. In view of the discussion as aforesaid, there is force in
the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner.

against the petitioners for the offences punishable under Section

liable to be granted.

23. Respondent No.2 is highly unjustified in proposing
investigation against the petitioner for the commission of the
offences as aforesaid to launch a prosecution. In the said
circumstances, the proceedings proposed by respondent No.2 as
per the report filed by him before the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court No.1, Thrissur under Section 167 Cr..C is only
liable to be quashed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C stands allowed. All further
proceedings proposed to be conducted by respondent No.2 and
already initiated pursuant to that based on Annexure Al stands
quashed forthwith.
