xv. 7.8.70 JUDGE
 B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Crl.M.C. No.4064 of 2016

Dated this the 5" day of January, 2018

Presently, the parties have made recourse to the
civil proceedings and the First Additional District Court,
Ernakulam, which is dealing with Church cases, is in seisin
of the matter. An interim order of status quo has already
been passed by the First Additional District Court,
Ernakulam, in the matter pending as OS.29/2017 before that
court. Therefore, the proceedings before the learned Sub
Divisional Magistrate, Thrissur in MC.23/1974 have become
infructuous. Therefore, the impugned order is liable to be
quashed.

In the result, this Cri.M.C. is disposed of and
 C.M.C.4064/2016

Annexure-V order is quashed. The proceedings in
MC.23/1974 shall be kept in abeyance till the final disposal
of the civil suit.
