This case having been finally heard on 11.02.2025 and this Court on
13.02.2025 pronounced the following: «

JUDGMENT.
1. This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of
Police, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 1367 of 2013 for the offences
punishable under Section 394 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred
toas the IPC’).

2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: : On 19.11.2013 at 9.30 PM
‘at Cheruvakkal village, Chithravila Road, the Accused persons in furtherance of
their common intention, wrongfully restrained the Informant and CW2, The 2"
Accused pushed CW2 by having caught hold of his neck and the 3" Accused
slapped on his left cheek, The 4 Accused kicked on the abdomen of CW2 who had
fallen down and the 1* Accused forcibly took away an amount of Rs. 500/- and
Nokia Mobile from CW2’s pockets. The Informant who attempted to resist them
‘was physically assaulted by the Accused persons and criminally intimidated by
them with an injury to his person, if he attempts to lodge a complaint with the

 3

police. Thereby the Accused persons are alleged to have committed the above:
‘mentioned offence.

3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 394 of the
IPC, on the basis of the Final Report. On issuance of process, the Accused Persons
‘entered appearance. They were enlarged on bail and were represented by a
Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were
furnished to them. Pursuant to hearing both the sides on question of framing
‘charge, the charge was framed for the aforesaid offence. The charge was read over
‘and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs6 and 7 were examined as PW 1 and PW2
respectively. Exhibits P1 to P7 and MO1 were also marked. The presence of CWI
to 4 could not be procured by the Prosecution and report filed to that effect by the
Prosecution that their presence cannot be procured in the near future. CWS was
reported to be in abroad. Accused was examined under Section 313(1)(b) of the
CrPC wherein he denied all the incriminating circumstance adduced against him
by the Prosecution. No Defence evidence was adduced by the Accused.

5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points
arise for consideration.

a, Have the Accused Persons voluntarily caused hurt to CWs 1 and 2 in
committing robbery as alleged and thereby committed offence punishable
under section 394 of IPC?

b. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?

6 Point (a): PWI_ deposed that he was the Station House Officer,
Sreekaryam at the relevant period of time. He deposed that Exhibit P1 FIS was
recorded by him on the basis of information given by the Informant to the effect
that the latter was a foreman in charge of construction work near Sreekaryam and
‘that while he was on his way back along with CW2, they were wrongfully
restrained by around four persons, assaulted them and robbed the mobile phone

 4

‘and Rs, 500/- from the pocket of CW2. On the basis of the same, he registered
Exhibit P2 FIR.

PW2, the Investigating Officer deposed that he prepared Exhibit P3 Scene
Mahazar after visiting the place of occurrence. He deposed that he had effected
the arrest of the Accused persons and Exhibit P4 series and Exhibit P5 Series, that
is, the Arrest and Inspection Memos respectively were prepared by him. Exhibit P6
is the Address Report and he deposed that the Nokia Mobile Phone and Rs. 500/-
was recovered from the Accused person and the same was produced before this
Court by incorporating the same in Exhibit P7 KPF 151A Form, He further deposed
‘that he can very well identify the said phone so recovered and identified M.O. 1
before the Court. He also deposed that he is able to identify the Accused persons
who have committed the aforesaid offences and identified them,

‘The Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that neither the alleged
injured witnesses nor the occurrence witnesses have turned up before this Court to
prove the case of the Prosecution. Despite the deposition of PW2 that MOI and the
currency note was allegedly recovered from the 1" Accused, there is no evidence
put forth to the effect that it was in fact the same phone or cash alleged to have
been robbed by them from CW2. Nor has the same been identified by the witness
either before the Court or otherwise.

This Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and also the
submissions of the Learned Counsel for the Accused and the Learned APP. On
going through the evidence and the materials on record, itis pertinent to note that
neither the injured nor the occurrence witnesses have mounted the box to prove
the Prosecution case. The Prosecution failed to secure their presence. Merely upon
the deposition of PW2 that MO1 was recovered from the 1" Accused and the same
‘were identified by the witnesses, there cannot be conviction of the Accused
persons for the aforesaid offence. There is no identification of MO.1 by the injured
witnesses before the Court. The fact of alleged assaults, restraint, intimidation
have not been brought forth in evidence. In fact, there is nothing before this Court
to implicate the Accused persons to the alleged incident. The alleged incident itself

 5

{is not proved. There is no proof at all of the Prosecution case, much less a proof
beyond reasonable doubt. The Prosecution has failed to establish the ingredients
of the alleged offence and the involvement of the Accused persons in the same.
Hence these points are found in favour of the Accused.

7. Point (a): In light of the finding above, question of sentencing the Accused
does not arise.

8. Inthe result, the Accused persons are found not guilty of having committed
the offence punishable under Sections 394 of the IPC and are acquitted thereof
under Section 248(1) of CrPC. Their bail bonds stand canceled and they are set at
bert.

‘The M.O.1 and the currency Note entered in Property Register of this Court
as T. No. 264/2013 shall be disposed of subject to the Rules, pursuant to the lapse
‘of period of Appeal. In case any Appeal is preferred, the disposal shall be pursuant
to the finality of the Appeal thereof.
