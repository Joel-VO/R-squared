Cri.M.C. No.3882 of 2016

Dated this the 4" day of August, 2016
ORDER

1.The petitioner is the accused in L.P.C. No.66 of 2013
on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class
Court-II, Hosdurg.

2.0n his failure to appear before the learned Magistrate,
non bailable warrant has been issued against him. The
petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate directions
to the learned Magistrate to consider his application for
recall of warrant and grant of bail on the date of
surrender itself and to grant him bail.

3.It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the co-accused has been acquitted after
trial by Annexure-A3 judgment dated 14.3.2014 in

Crl.Appeal No.145 of 2012.
 CALM.C.3882/2016 2

4.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the
petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued
against him to secure his presence before the court
below. This court in exercise of powers under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be
justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned
Magistrate in granting bail.

5.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned
Magistrate and appraise the reasons for his absence
and to seek for recalling the warrant and grant of bail.
There is no reason for this Court to assume that the
learned Magistrate will not exercise his discretion
judicially and in accordance with law.

6.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender
before the trial court within 2 weeks from the date of
this order and prefer application for recall of warrant

and also for grant of bail with advance notice to the
 CALM.C.3882/2016 3
prosecutor concerned. In that event the learned
Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the
said application, uninfluenced by the pendency of the
warrant, preferably on the same day itself, on its
merits and in accordance with law.

Coercive proceedings , if any shall be kept in abeyance

till then. Petition is disposed off as above.
