B. KEMAL PASHA, J.

Dated this the 5” day of January, 2018

Petitioner is the 1% accused in CC No.942/2014
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kattappana,
based on Annexure-III final report in Crime No.2065/2012 of
Kattappana Police Station for the offences punishable under
Sections 336 and 288 read with Section 34 IPC.

2. The main complaint of the petitioner is that the
court below has taken cognizance of the offences even
when the final report was hopelessly barred by limitation.

3. It seems that no opportunity was granted to the
petitioner to challenge the said fact. In order to condone the
inordinate delay, an opportunity ought to have been granted
to the petitioner by the court below. Matters being so, the
taking of cognizance of Annexure-III final report is liable to

be quashed.
 2018KERIOT
CHLM.C.5808/2015

In the result, this Cr.M.C. is allowed and all further
proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.942/2014 of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kattappana, based
on Annexure-Iil final report in Crime No.2065/2012 of
Kattappana Police Station, are quashed. An opportunity
shall be given to the petitioner to challenge the proceedings.
The petitioner shall appear before the court below on the
next posting date.
