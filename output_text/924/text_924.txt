This case having been finally heard on today the court on the same day delivered the

following :=
JUDGMENT
1. This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura Police
 Station in crime No, 29/2008 against the accused alleging offences
Punishable ws 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC.

‘The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to enmity towards CWI
‘who questioned the act of the accused passing comments on CW2 and in

furtherance of their common intention on 28/10/2008 at 9.30 pm, at the public

‘oad from Thirumala Junction towards Poojappura, the 1" accused hit CW1
above the right eye with an iron pipe which was a dangerous weapon and the
2* accused kicked him down thereby causing injury and hurt to him. When
‘CW? intervened, the 1* accused slapped on her left cheek and on her left arm
and thereby outraged her modesty. The accused thereby committed the
offences as alleged against him,

Originally the case was taken on file as CC: 16/2009 against the present
accused. The 2" accused involved was a Juvenile in conflict with law and the
‘case against him is split up and filed before the Juvenile Justice Board, Since
the accused was absconding, the case was entered in LPR as LP: 10/2010,
‘When the accused was arrested and produced before the court his case was
taken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 112/2010. Accused was granted bail in
this case, Accused was furnished with copies of all relevant prosecution
records. After hearing, charge for the offences w/s 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of
IPC was framed, read over and it was explained to the accused, he pleaded not
‘guilty. Thereafter, the case was posted for examination of witnesses. At that
time, the accused was again absconded and the case was again entered in LPR
as LP: 171/2018. When the accused was arrested and produced before the

‘court his case was taken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 1161/2018. Accused
 ‘was enlarged on bail.
To prove their case, the prosecution examined CWI and CW2 as PW1 and
PW2 and marked a document as Ext.PL. Since the witnesses examined did
not support the prosecution, CW3 to CW9 were given up by the learned APP.
Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating,
circumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination ws 313
of CrP. was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.

|. Heard both the sides.

‘The points that arise for consideration are:~

1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable ws 323,
324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?
2. What shall be the sentence or order?

Point No.1 i: The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 2 witnesses

and 1 document from the side of the prosecution, PW/1 is the defacto

‘complainant. He affirmed the occurrence on 28/10/2008 in which he was

attacked by three persons when he questioned them for abusing his wife

(PW2). He admitted Ext.P1 FI Statement given to police. However, he

categorically stated that he could not identify the assailants. PW2 also

deposed in similar lines and failed to identify the accused, Both the witness
stated that the matters were settled and that they had no further grievances.
‘Thus, all the material witnesses turned hostile to prosecution. Therefore, the
Jeamed Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses. From
the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged or to

‘connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove
 4
that the accused committed the offences ws 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC
Point No.1 is found against the prosecution.

Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused is found not
‘guilty of the offences punishable w/s 323, 324, 354 riw 34 of IPC he is
acquitted ws 248(1) of Cr.PC and set at liberty, cancelling his bail bond.
Property produced in this case as T 533/2008, iron pipe, shall be confiscated.
Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected
and pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28° day of February 2025.
