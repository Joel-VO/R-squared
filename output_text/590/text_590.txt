CrL.M.C.No. 7179 of 2016
Dated this the 11" day of January, 2017
ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in CC No.806/2016
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Nedumangad for
offences punishable under Sections 451 & 294(b) of IPC and
Section 118(a) of KP Act.

2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 4/4/2016 at 11
15PM, the accused, after consuming alcohol, trespassed into
Valiyamala police station and uttered obscene words. He refused
to comply with the lawful directions given by the woman police
constable. Crime was registered and after investigation final report
‘was laid.

3. Contenting that he is a highly religious person, that he was
falsely implicated due to reasons best known to him and that the
police have made every attempt to procure certificate to make it
appear that the petitioner was drunk at the time of the incident,
the petitioner has approached this Court seeking reliefs. It was
contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, relying on
‘Annexure AIII certificate, that the petitioner herein was certified to
be not drunk by the duty doctor attached to the Nedumangad

District Hospital . It was further contended that pressure was

exerted on the doctor to give the certificate otherwise.

4, Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that
the petitioner herein is involved in other cases and that alcometer
test conducted on the relevant day established that he was drunk
at the relevant time. But, the doctor gave a certificate to the
contrary. It was submitted that hence a complaint was submitted
to the Director of Health Services

5. 1 do not propose to go into the merits of the relevant
contentions except to hold that essentially it is a matter to be
established by the prosecution on the basis of the evidence let in by
it at the time of trial. Hence, the question now cannot be
answered in the light of the materials available to held that no
material is placed before the court below to prove the allegations.

In the light of the above, I am not inclined to invoke the
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr-P.C. However, the petitioner
herein will be free to raise all his objections before the trial court

even at the appropriate stage.
