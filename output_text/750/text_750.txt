Dated this the 4° day of January, 2018
ORDER

Petitioners are accused in Crime No.1197 of 2017 of
the Pooyappally Police Station, Kollam District, registered for
the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324 and
308 IPC read with Section 34 IPC.

2. It seems that the matter has been amicably settled
between the parties.

3. On going through the facts and circumstances of
the case, it seems that the matter can be permitted to be
settled. It has been reported that no criminal antecedents
have been reported against the petitioners. This Court is
satisfied that there are no ingredients to invite an offence
under Section 308 IPC in the matter. The defacto complainant
and the other affected person have filed Annexure-2 and
Annexure-3 affidavits affirming that the matter has been
amicably settled between them and the petitioners and they

have no complaints against the petitioners. Considering the
 (Cr.M.C.No.88089 of 2017 2
fact that the matter has already been settled amicably
between the parties, this court is satisfied that no purpose
would be served in proceeding with the trial of the case,
Matters being so, Annexure-1 First Information Report in
Crime No.1197 of 2017 of the Pooyapally Police Station,
Kollam District, and all further proceedings in it, as against the
petitioners, are liable to be quashed.

In the result, this CrlM.C. is allowed and Annexure-1
First Information Report in Crime No.1197 of 2017 of the
Pooyapally Police Station, Kollam District, and all further

proceedings in it, as against the petitioners, are hereby

quashed.
