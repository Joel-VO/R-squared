ORDER

This is an application filed by the petitioner to
modify the condition imposed by the court below and
directed the magistrate to release the passport under

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

2. It is alleged in the petition that, the
petitioner was arrayed as 4" accused in C.C.609/2011 on
the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-Il,
Perinthalmanna. It was originated on the basis of Crime
No.299/2011 of Melattur police station, alleging offences
under Section 143, 147, 341, 323, and 324 read with
Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and he was charge-
sheeted along with four accused persons. After
investigation final report was filed and it was taken on file
as C.C.No.609/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna. Thereafter he

appeared and he was released on bail. Later he obtained
 wisKERATIIS
Cr. MC. No.2302 of 2015 ,

job in Saudi Arabia and so he could not appear. Other
accused, except first accused faced trial and the
prosecution witnesses were examined and the accused were
questioned under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Since he was absconded at that time, the case
against him was split up and refilled as C.C.No.107/2014.
Since he apprehended that, he will be remanded on his
appearance, he moved this court by _ filing
Crl.M.C.No.6637/2014 and this court directed the petitioner
to surrender and directed the magistrate to consider and
dispose of the bail application on the date of filing the
application itself as per Annexure-2 order. Accordingly, he
surrendered before the court below and he was released on
bail, on executing a bond for %20,000/- and also with
sureties and also surrender his passport. Accordingly he
surrendered his passport. His visa expires on 27.04.2015.
If he was not permitted to go abroad, he will lose his

employment. So he has no other remedy except to approach
 201SKERA7HS

Cr. M.C, No.2302 of 2015,

this court, seeking the following relief:

“It is most humbly prayed that this hon’ble court may be
pleased to modify the condition No.2 in Annexure-A3 order, direct
the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court ll, Perinthalmanna to
release the passport of the petitioner and permit the petitioner to
leave for Saudi Arabia on appropriate terms and conditions in the
interest of justice.”

3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and
Public Prosecutor.

4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that,
he will be satisfied with the direction to consider the
application filed by him for release of the passport for a
temporary period for renewing the visa and go abroad as
provided in Asok Kumar v. State of Kerala [2009(2)
KLT 712] and Muhammed v. State of Kerala [2012(4)
KLT 655].

5. The application was opposed by the Public
Prosecutor.

6. On going through the allegations made in the
petition itself, the directions to surrender passport to
ensure the presence of the petitioner for trial cannot be said

to be illegal. But however, if the trial of the case will take
 wisKERATIIS
Cr. MC. No.2302 of 2015 4
time and if the visa is likely to be expired and for renewing
his visa, he will have to go abroad and the passport is
required for that purpose, then, if he files an application
before the Magistrate Court for that purpose, that court has
to consider and dispose of the same as per the directions
given in the dictum laid down in Asok Kumar v. State of
Kerala [2009(2) KLT 712] and Muhammed v. State of
Kerala [2012(4) KLT 655]. So under the circumstances,
this court feels that, there is no necessity to interfere with
the order passed, but at the same time, the petition can be
disposed of, giving direction to the magistrate to consider
the application if any filed by the petitioner for that purpose
and dispose of the same. So the application is disposed of as
follows:
If the petitioner applies before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-II, Perinthalmanna,
for releasing his passport for the purpose of going

abroad temporarily to renew the visa, then the
 201SKERA7HS

Cr. M.C, No.2302 of 2015,

learned magistrate is directed to consider and
dispose of the application on the date of filing of
the application itself, after hearing the Assistant
Public Prosecutor of that court, considering the
dictum laid down in the decisions reported in
Asok Kumar and Muhammed's case (supra).

With the above direction and observation, the
petition is disposed of accordingly.

Office is directed to hand over the copy of the
order to the counsel for the petitioner on usual terms as per
rules at the earliest, so as to enable him to produce the
same before the court below for getting the relief
mentioned in the order. Office is also directed to
communicate this order to the court below by fax,
immediately.
