CrI.M.C.No.8437 of 2019

Dated this the 6" day of January, 2020

ORDER

The petitioners are the accused in the case
C.C.No.460/2019 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate-II, Mavelikkara.

2. The offences alleged against the petitioners are
punishable under Sections 57(a) and 56(b) of the Abkari Act,
1077

3. The first petitioner is the Manager and the second
petitioner is the licensee of the toddy shop No.24/2018-19 of the
Nooranad Excise Range. The Excise Inspector of Nooranad Excise

Range took three samples of toddy from the aforesaid shop on

08.12.2018. The samples were marked as ‘A’ sample, 'B' sample

and 'C’ sample. The chemical analysis of ‘A’ sample revealed that
 20201KERI72

1E1.M.C.8o.€437/2019

the said sample contained Sodium Lauryl Suphate, an adulterant.

Annexure-A is the copy of the certificate relating to the analysis
of ‘A’ sample. On the basis of Annexure-A certificate, a case was
registered against the petitioners as C.R.No.11/2019 of the

Nooranad Excise Range.

4, The 'B’ sample was sent for chemical analysis at the
instance of the petitioners. It was sent through the court.
Annexure-B certificate of analysis in respect of the 'B' sample

shows that no Sodium Lauryl Sulphate was detected in it.

5. Even before the receipt of Annexure-B certificate,
chargesheet against the petitioners was filed in the court for the
offences mentioned above. Learned Magistrate has taken

cognizance of the offences.

6. This petition is filed under Section 482 CrP.C for
quashing the proceedings against the petitioners which are based
‘on Annexure-C chargesheet.

7. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the

learned Public Prosecutor.
 20201KERI72

1E1.M.C.8o.€437/2019

8, Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that in
view of the contradictory chemical analysis reports, the

prosecution against the petitioners is liable to be quashed.

9. Learned Public Prosecutor contended that the accused
had no right to get the second sample analysed and therefore,
Annexure-B certificate cannot be taken into consideration by the

court.

10. The question whether the accused had right to get the
second sample sent for chemical analysis does not arise in this
case. The fact remains that the State did not challenge the order
of the learned Magistrate allowing the application filed by the

petitioners for sending the second sample for analysis.

11. Annexure-C chargesheet against the petitioners was

filed in the court on 25.10.2019. Annexure-B report is dated
28.10.2019. Annexure-C chargesheet was filed in the court even
before the receipt of Annexure-B report. It means that there can
be nothing in the chargesheet which would enable the

prosecution to challenge the correctness of Annexure-B report.
 20201KERI72

1E1.M.C.8o.€437/2019

If the second report is in favour of the accused and if there is no
material in the final report to disprove or discredit the report in
respect of the second sample or if there is no challenge against
the report in respect of the second sample, then the final report

is liable to be quashed. In view of Annexure-B certificate of

analysis, no successful prosecution can be sustained. Even if the
Prosecution is permitted to be continued, no purpose would be
served. Therefore, I am inclined to quash Annexure-C
chargesheet and further proceedings against the petitioners

based on it.

12. In the result, this petition is allowed. Annexure-C final
report laid in C.R.No.11/2019 of the Nooranad Excise Range and
all further proceedings pursuant thereto, as against the

petitioners, are hereby quashed.
