Cri. M.C No. 183 of 2015

Dated this the 13® day of January, 2015.

ORDER

The petitioner herein is the original second accused in C.C
No.576/11 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-V, Kozhikode.
‘The offences involved in the case are under Sections 323 and 324
IPC. The said crime was registered on the complaint of one Saleem.
The other three accused in the case faced trial before the learned
Magistrate in C.C No.576/2011, and obtained a judgment of
acquittal on 28.1.2014, when the de facto complainant turned
hostile to the prosecution during trial, in view of an amicable
settlement made by the parties out of court. The case against the
petitioner herein was split up and refiled as C.C 188/2014. He now
seeks orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that
continuance of proceeding against him in the above circumstance
will not serve any purpose. The Annexure C Judgment in C.C
No.576/2011 shows that, when examined as the material witness

in the said case, the de facto complainant Saleem did not in any

manner support the prosec in view of

‘ion. He fully turned hostil

an amicable settlement made out of court. Definite it is that
 201SKERAISIS

CCl, MAC No. 183 of 2015 2
continuance of prosecution against the petitioner herein in the
above circumstance will not serve any purpose, because the
prosecution cannot in any manner improve the case as against him,
if the case goes to trial. Practically, such continuance will be a
sheer waste of time.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against
the petitioner in C.C No.188/2014 of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate -V, Kozhikode will stand quashed under Section 482

Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from

prosecution and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand

discharged.

JUDGE
