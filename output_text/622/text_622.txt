Cri.M.C.No.7626 of 2019

Dated this the 6” day of January, 2020
ORDER

The petitioner is the complainant in the case S.T No.147/2019
on the file of the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur.

2. The complaint filed by the petitioner against the first
respondent is under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’).

3. During the trial of the aforesaid case, the
petitioner/complainant was examined as PW1. During the cross-
examination of PW1, the first respondent/accused denied the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Thereafter, the petitioner filed Annexure-E
petition before the trial court for sending the cheque to an expert for
obtaining opinion on the signature therein. As per Annexure-F order,
the learned Magistrate dismissed the aforesaid application. The
aforesaid order is challenged in this petition filed under Section 482
CrP.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the

first respondent.

1626 oF 2019(c!

5. Before considering the merits of the order passed by the
learned Magistrate, it is pertinent to note that the first
respondent/accused had made a complaint against the
petitioner/complainant alleging that the petitioner had forged the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque and a case was registered against the
complainant by the police in that matter. After investigation of the
aforesaid case, the police filed chargesheet against the
petitioner/complainant and another person for committing the offences
punishable under Sections 379,420,465,468 and 471 read with 34
IPC. The aforesaid case is pending before the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Thrissur as C.C No. 166/2016.

6. The case filed by the petitioner/complainant against the
first respondent for the offence under Section 138 of the Act was
pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Thrisuur as C.C
No. 2875/2013. The aforesaid case was withdrawn to his court by the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate and renumbered as S.T No.
147/2019.

7. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the parties before
this Court that simultaneous trial of the aforesaid two cases has been

held in the court below.
 2020KERIND

1626 oF 2019(c!

8. It is also pertinent here to note that, during the
investigation of the case filed by the accused against the complainant,
the police had collected specimen signatures of the accused and got
the signature in Ext.P1 cheque compared with such specimen
signatures and obtained a report of the expert. It is submitted before
this Court by the counsel for both sides that the expert opinion
obtained in that case is that the disputed signature in the cheque

differs with the standard signatures.

9. The application filed by the petitioner, for sending the
cheque for obtaining the opinion of an expert with regard to the
signature therein, was dismissed by the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate mainly for two reasons. The first reason is that the
complainant was very well aware even earlier that the accused does
not admit the signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Learned Magistrate has
stated in the impugned order that even before the signature in Ext.P1
cheque was denied by the accused during the cross-examination of
PW1, the complainant was aware of the aforesaid plea by the accused.
The second reason stated by the learned Magistrate for dismissing the

application filed by the complainant is that there is already an expert

ble in C.C No. 166/2016 and if the complainant has got
 2020KERIND

1626 oF 2019(c!
5

dispute regarding the correctness of the expert opinion available

before the court, he can examine the expert and prove it.

10. As per the submissions made before this Court by the
learned counsel for the parties, what the police had done during the
investigation of the case registered against the complainant was to get
‘an expert opinion with regard to the signature in Ext.P1 cheque by
‘comparison of it with the specimen signatures taken from the accused.
When the prosecution case in C.C No. 166/2016 is that the
complainant in S.T No. 147/2019 is the person who forged the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque, I fail to understand how the expert opinion
obtained by the police would help the prosecution in C.C No. 16/2016
to prove the case against the complainant. What is to be proved by
the prosecution in C.C No. 166/2016 is that the complainant in S.T No.
147/2019 is the author of the signature in Ext.P1 cheque and not
whether it is a signature put by some other person or not.

11. The two reasons stated by the learned Magistrate for
dismissing the application filed by the complainant are not sustainable.
The first reason stated by the learned Magistrate is that the
complainant was very well aware of the plea of the accused very
earlier but he did not take any steps earlier to send the cheque for

expert opinion. The complainant had every right to wait till the
 2020KERIND

7626 oF 2019(C)
6

completion of his evidence and to make his own assessment of the
evidence and decide whether it is necessary to send the cheque for
expert opinion. He might have been earlier confident that he could
adduce sufficient evidence to prove the execution of the cheque by the
accused. Only if the evidence adduced by him is found to be
insufficient to prove the execution of the cheque by the accused, it
would have been necessary for him to take steps to send the cheque
for expert opinion. Moreover, mere denial of the signature in the
cheque by the accused does not oblige the complainant to get expert
opinion in that regard

12. The other reason stated by the learned Magistrate, that the
complainant can examine the expert and prove that the report of the
expert obtained in the other case is incorrect, is also not sustainable.
It is submitted before this Court by the counsel for the parties that no
joint or consolidated trial of the two cases is conducted and what is
conducted is only simultaneous trial of both cases. If that be so, the
findings in one case cannot be based on the evidence in the other
case. The complainant in S.T No. 147/2019 will not be able to bring
the evidence in the other case to prove his case. Moreover, it is a
report obtained by the police during the investigation of the case

registered against him. As noticed earlier, the expert opinion in C.C
 2020KERIND

7626 oF 2019(C)
z

No. 16/2016 was obtained by comparison of the signature in Ext.P1

‘cheque with the specimen signatures of the accused which were

collected during the investigation. It is not a report obtained by

‘comparison of the signature in Ext.P1 cheque with the signatures of

the accused which were anterior in time to the date of the cheque.

13. Inspite of the above findings, I am of the view that, for
another reason, the learned Magistrate was justified in dismissing the
application filed by the complainant. Annexure-E application filed by
the complainant does not contain the necessary details to be included
in an application for sending a document for expert opinion. It is not
stated in Annexure-E application to whom the cheque has to be sent
for expert opinion, whether it is to be sent to the forensic science
laboratory or to a private expert or to some other person. It is also
not stated in Annexure-E application how the comparison of the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque has to be made, whether the comparison
has to be made with the specimen signatures of the accused to be
obtained from him or whether the comparison has to be made with the
signatures of the accused contained in some documents anterior in
time. If the comparison has to be made with the signatures of the
accused in some documents which are anterior in time to the date of

Ext.P1 cheque, it has to be mentioned in the application, whether any
 2020KERIND

7626 oF 2019(C)

a
such documents are available. In the absence of any such particulars
mentioned in Annexure-E application, even if the Magistrate had found
that the cheque had to be sent for expert opinion, the application
could not have been allowed by the learned Magistrate.

14, At this juncture, it would be advantageous to refer to a
passage from the decision in Ajithkumar v. Rejin Kumar: ILR
2009(3) Kerala 43, which gives a clear idea regarding the burden on
the parties to prove the genuineness of the signature in the cheque in
@ case under Section 138 of the Act. In the aforesaid decision, this
Court had held as follows:

“The learned Magistrate has compared the signatures
of the drawer in Ext.P1 with the admitted signatures
of the accused in some documents, Ext.P5
acknowledgement card and Ext.03 specimen
signature card of the accused produced by D.W.2,
which was maintained by the bank wherein the
account relating to Ext.P1 was operated. In the
impugned judgment, reference is also made that
comparison was made with another document
exhibited as Ext.05, presumably it must be @ mistake
as Exts.D1 to D3 alone were exhibited by the accused.
Strangely enough, no comparison was made by the
learned Magistrate of the signature appearing in
Ext.P1 with the signatures of the accused seen in
Ext.P7 agreement, Signature of the accused in Ext.PS
acknowledgement card and his _valkalath for

 "rl. .MC.No. 7626 OF 2019(C) 2020KERILS2

ignature of the accused in Ext.P5 acknowledgement

Strangely enough, the learned Magistrate has also
taken the statement of PW.1 in his evidence that
there is difference in the signature of Ext.P1 and PS
acknowledgement card of the accused as a
circumstance justifying his conclusion that the
signature in Ext.P1 cheque differed from the
signatures of the accused in other documents. The
accused who disputed his signature in Ext.P1 has not
taken_any step to substantiate his plea of not signing
that_instrument_was lost sight of by the learned
Magistrate when he proceeded to compare the
signature appearing in Ext.P1 with the signatures of
the accused in some documents of which other than
Ext.03 specimen card could have been given any
value for the purpose of comparison. I fail to
understand why the learned Magistrate has not
verified the signature in Ext.P1 with Ext.P7
agreement, the stamp papers which had been
purchased in the name of the accused nearly four
months prior to the presentation of Ext.P1 cheque
before the bank. No burden was cast upon the
ext i fc
 Ce1.MC,No.7626 OF 2019(¢) 2020KERILS2

accused to establish his defence that the instrument
ittedly cove hi maintained by hit

fraudulent! ribed meone else in Ext.P1
instrument_as_contended by the accused, he should

for forensic examination with such other documents
containing his signatures subscribed at an anterior
point of time earlier to Ext,P1, No such step was taken
by the accused other than causing the production of
Ext.D3 specimen signature card relating to his account
which is hardly sufficient to show that Ext.P1
instrument was not signed by him. He has not even
made any attempt to substantiate his defence over
the denial of his signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Opinion
given by D.W.2, the Secretary of the Bank that the
signature in Ext.P1 differed from the signatures of the
accused in Ext.D3 specimen card, which, of course,
the learned Magistrate has not taken into account, is
unworthy of any value.”

(emphasis supplied)

15. Therefore, it is for the complainant to rethink whether the
evidence adduced by him is sufficient to prove the execution of Ext.P1
cheque by the accused. If he is advised that it is necessary to get
expert opinion with regard to the signature in Ext.P1 cheque, I find
that it would be proper to give him an opportunity to file a proper

application before the trial court for that purpose.

16. Consequently, the petition is dismissed. However, the
petitioner/complainant is at liberty to file a fresh application in the
court below for sending the cheque for expert opinion for comparison
of the signature therein with the signature of the accused/first
respondent. Such application, if any, shall be filed by him within a
week from today. If any such application is filed by the
petitioner/complainant with necessary particulars as indicated in this
order, the learned Magistrate shall dispose of it on merits within a
period of two weeks from the date of filing it.

17. The interim order passed by this Court on 20.11.2019 in
Crl.M.A No. 1/2019 will stand vacated on the expiry of a period of one

week from today.
