ORDER

‘The petitioner herein is arrayed as accused No.2 in SC
'No.94/2012 of the Addl.Sessions Court No.lV, Palakkad for
offences punishable under Section 55 (a) of the Abkari Act.

2. On 17/4/2010, the Excise Party intercepted the first
accused who was found to have been concealing spirit. Crime was
registered against the first accused. The petitioner herein was also
included in the array of the accused on the basis of the statement
given by the first accused that it was the second accused who had
supplied the spirit.

3. Contending that, apart from the alleged confession
statement of the co-accused , there is no other material to connect:
the petitioner herein with the crime and that the alleged confession
will not stand in the eye of law, the petitioner seeks to quash the
proceedings.

4, Learned Public Prosecutor also, with reference to the
available materials, fairly admitted that the only material relied on
by the prosecution is the confession of the first accused.

5, It is settled by the various decisions that co-accused cannot

be roped in with the aid of the statement of the other accused.
 2017KERAST

C¥LM.C.BN0 6822/2016 2
Learned counsel for the petitioner further relied on Annexure C
and D judgments wherein relying on the decision reported in Lissy
Kurian v. State of Kerarla [2004 (1) KLJ 877), this Court has
held that confession of co-accused cannot be by itself the sole basis
for implication.

6. I am satisfied that the above decision is squarely applicable
to the the facts of this case. In the light of the above, the
successful prosecution against the petitioner herein on the basis of
the available materials may not be legally sustainable. In the light
of the above, I am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C.

In the result, Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings in
relation to the petitioner herein pursuant to Annexure-B final

report of the Addl. Sessions Court No.1V, Palakkad stand quashed.
