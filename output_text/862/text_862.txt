UDGMENT

‘The accused Nos.2 to 4 were put on trial for the offences punishable

under section 341, 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The prosecution’s case in brief is as follows:- That at around
5.45 p.m., on 22.12.2012, the informant - Shameer by driving the
government motor car bearing registration No.KL-01-BD-9622 reached
near the Cotton Hill School, Vazhuthacaudu, and then the motor cycle
bearing No. KL-01-BF-4029 somehow fell down touching the motor car
driven by the informant. He enquired about this matter and out of this
 3

animosity, the accused wrongfully restrained the informant and the
accused Nos.1 and 2 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant by hitting
him with hand and abused him uttering obscene words to his annoyance
and the accused Nos. 3 and 4 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant and
torn off the shirt that worn by the informant and thereby the accused
obstructed the informant from discharging his official duty as such public
servant, The accused, thereby committed the offences punishable under
section 294(b), 341, 323 and 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

3. The Sub Inspector of Police, Museum Police Station,
registered the case as Crime No.1291/2012 on the basis of the First
Information Statement given by the informant and conducted the
investigation and submitted the charge sheet before this court. On the
basis of the charge sheet, cognizance was taken for the offences punishable
under section 341, 294(b), 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code
and the charge sheet was taken on file as Calendar Case No.1618/2015.

4, Summons was issued to the accused. ‘The accused Nos. 2 to
4 appeared before the court. ‘The Ist accused absconded. So the case

against him was split up. ‘The accused Nos.2 to 4 were enlarged on bail.

My predecessor-in-of
under section 341, 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code and read

¢ framed the charges for the offences punishable

and explained to the accused in Malayalam to which they pleaded not guilty.

5. The prosecution’s evidence consists of the oral evidence of PWI
to PWS and the documentary evidence of Ext.P1 to P14. After closing the
evidence of the prosecution, the accused Nos. 2 to 4 were questioned under
They denied all
brought out in evidence against them. Though they were called upon to enter

section 313 of the Cr.

ating. circumstances

defence and adduce evidence, they did not adduce any evidence.
 4

6. Heard both parties. Perused the records.

7. The points that arise for consideration are as follows:-

1. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common
intention, wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby
committed the offence punishable under section 341 r/w
sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code?

2. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common
intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby
committed the offence punishable under section 323 r/w
seC.34 of the Indian Penal Code?

3. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common
intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with intent to
prevent PWI from discharging his official duty and
thereby committed the offence punishable under section
332 iw sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code?

4, What should be the proper punishment to be awarded
to the accused Nos.2 to 4 if they are found guilty of any
offence?

8 Point Nos.t to 3:- For convenience of discussion of evidence,
these three points are considered together. ‘Though coercive steps were
repeatedly issued and many opportunities were given, the prosecution could
not either bring PW1 to the court or get him examined through audio vedio
electronic linkage. The prosecution examined PW1 and PW2 stating that
they are the eye witnesses. They did not support the prosecution’s case
stating that they had not seen the transaction resulting injury to the informant.
Though the prosecution examined the investigating officer, there is nothing
on record to prove the charges as there is no substantive evidence. There is
 5

no evidence to show that the accused Nos.2 to 4 in furtherance of their
common intention, wrongfully restrained the informant or voluntarily caused
hurt to him, Hence these points are found against the prosecution.

9. Point No4:- Since the prosecution failed to prove that the
accused had committed any offence, there does not arise any question of
imposing punishment on them. Hence this point is also found against the
prosecution.

In the result, the accused Nos. 2 to 4 are found not guilty of the
offences punishable under section 341, 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian
Penal Code. Hence they are acquitted under section 248(1) of the CrP.C.
‘Their bail bonds stand cancelled. They are set at liberty. The case against the
Ist accused is re-filed as Calendar Case No.2310/2015.
