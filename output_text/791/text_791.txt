Cri.M.C. No. 9082 of 2016

Dated this the 27" day of December, 2016

ORDER

1.This is an application to quash the proceedings in CC
No.1127/2015 now pending before the Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, which was
originated from Crime No.1379/2011 of Ernakulam
Town North Police Station, Ernakulam.

2.When the petition came up for hearing, the learned
counsel for the petitioners submitted before me that the
offence alleged is under Sections 380 and 457 of IPC. It
is also submitted that an offence under Section 380 of
IPC is compoundable whereas Section 457 is non
compoundable. The allegation is that the petitioners
committed theft of 5 kg of copper roll worth %500/-. It is
submitted that now, the matter has been settled.

3.1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well as

the learned counsel for the defacto complainant.
 CFLM.C. No, 9082 of 2016
2.

4.Learned counsel for the defacto complainant also
submitted before me that the matter is actually settled.

5.Surely, Section 457 is a non compoundable offence. At
the very same time, considering the totality of the case
and further keeping in mind that the matter has been
settled, I feel that the proceedings can be quashed by
exercising the power vested upon this Court under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence,
the proceedings in CC No.1127/2015 on the file of the
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam
is hereby quashed.

6.The Cri.M.C. is disposed of, as above.
