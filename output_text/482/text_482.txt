Cri.M.C.No.5460 of 2014

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2015
ORDER

The petitioners herein are the two accused in

C.C.No.1903/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Kollam, The 1* respondent herein is the defacto complainant in
the said crime, on whose complaint the police registered the
crime under Sections143, 147, 148, 427, 323 and Section 149
IPC, and Section 27 of the Arms Act, The petitioners now seek
orders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that they and the
defacto complainant have come to terms amicably out of court.
The complaint was in fact made against two named persons, and
some other identifiable persons. In spite of efforts made during
investigation, the police could not identify and detect those
persons, and so submitted final report against these two accused.
The defacto complainant has filed affidavit before this Court that
the whole dispute between him and the accused stands resolved
forever, and that he has no grievance or complaint now.

Though there is an allegation under the Arms Act, the
 201SKERII269

CMC. No Steaz018 2
sustainability of such prosecution is really doubtful. Any way, the
parties have come to terms amicably, and the defacto
complainant now does not want to continue the prosecution.
1 am well satisfied that there is a real and genuine settlement
between the parties, and in such a situation, continuance of
prosecution will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the
precious time of the court. Nobody will support the prosecution,
if the case goes to trial.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioners in C.C.No.1903/2009 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam will stand quashed under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand
released from prosecution. The bail bond, if any, executed by
them will stand discharged.
