CRL.M.C.No. 5932 of 2020

Dated this the 12" day of January, 2021
ORDER

Petitioner is the 2™ accused in Crime No.665 of 2020 of
Kozhinjampara Police Station registered for offences under Sections
41(1)(d) and 102 Cr.PC read with 34 of IPC. The allegation is that, at
about 3.15 a.m on 6.10.2020, silver ornaments weighing 11.120 kg
valued at around Rs.3,80,000/- was seized from a lorry bearing No.TN-
30-P-3208 and that, on questioning the driver of the lorry (3
accused), it was revealed that the 3 accused was not in possession of
any bill or other document evidencing payment of tax for the
omaments. That, on the same day, the petitioner and the 1st accused
were apprehended while sitting inside a car and on questioning, it was
admitted that they were waiting for the silver ornaments being
brought by the 3" accused. Thereupon, the crime was registered, the
petitioner and the other accused arrested and the silver ornaments

seized.

2. Later, the petitioner approached the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court, Chittoor seeking release of the silver ornaments
produced in Crime No.655 of 2020. While considering the application

for release, notice was issued to the State Tax Officer, SGST, Palakkad.
 CrLMC59322020 3 22UKERI2030

The said officer filed a report stating that the Taxes Department
intended to take action under Section 130 of the Central Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017, as the silver was transported without
invoices/bills etc. It was requested not to release the silver, the
applicable tax, penalty etc. as mandated under the GST Act are paid.
Thereupon, the petitioner paid an amount of Rs.1,67,824/- and this
fact was reported by the State Tax Officer. Since no other offence was
made out against the petitioner, the jurisdictional court passed

Annexure A3 order

ing interim custody of the silver ommaments to
the petitioner subject to certain conditions. This Crl.M.C is filed
aggrieved by condition No.3 in Annexure A3, directing the petitioner to
produce the silver ornaments as and when required and not to alienate

the same.

3. SriManu Ramachandran, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that, the petitioner having complied with the requirements
under the GST Act, the jurisdictional court committed an illegality in
imposing condition No.3. It is submitted that, as the petitioner is doing
business in silver, he will have to necessarily sell the ornaments as
part of his business and hence, unless the condition is deleted, the

petitioner will be put to undue prejudice and loss.

4, The question involved being one related to evasion of tax and
consequential action under the GST Act, the Special Government

Pleader (Taxes) was requested to address the court.
 CrLMC59322020 4 22UKERI2030

Sri.C.E.Unnikrishnan, learned Special Government Pleader (Taxes),
submitted, on instructions, that the petitioner having remitted the
penalty and the fine in lieu of confiscation as mandated under Section
130(2) of the GST Act, the Taxes Department has no objection in the

silver being released.

5. Sri.TRRenjit, learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, since
the crime is pending, release of the silver shall be on sufficient security

and conditions.

6. The offences alleged against the accused are under Sections

41(1)(d) and 102 of Cr.P.C. The crime was registered on the accused

failing to produce bills or tax receipts with respect to the silver seized
from the lorry. After registration of the crime, the petitioner remitted
the penalty and fine imposed by the Taxes Department. Condition
Nos.1 and 2 in Annexure A3 are sufficient to safeguard the interest of

the investigating agency.

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed by deleting condition No.3 in
Annexure A3. It is made clear that the silver ornaments seized shall be
released only on the petitioner complying with condition Nos.1 and 2 in
Annexure A3.
