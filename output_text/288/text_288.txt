Crl.M.C.No.2097 of 2015

Dated this the 24* day of April 2015

ORDER

This is an application filed by the petitioner to quash the

order issuing non-bailable warrant against the petitioner by Judicial
First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor in C.C. No.113 of
2012, under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
(hereinafter called 'the Code’).

2. Itis alleged in the petition that the petitioner is an accused
in C.C, No.113 of 2012 on the files of Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor, which was taken on file on the
basis of a private complaint filed by the complainant alleging

offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. After

trial, it ended in conviction and he filed Crl.Appeal No.30 of 2013
 201SKER7I6

CALM.C.2097/2015 2

before the Sessions Court, Ernakulam. Later it was transferred to

Additional Sessions Court, Muvattupuzha for disposal. He has not
received any information and no notice has been received by the
petitioner so far, It is now understood that non bailable warrant
has been issued by the Magistrate against the petitioner and that is
pending, So the petitioner has no other remedy except to approach
this court secking the following relief:

(i) Stop all the execution proceedings in C.C, No.113/2012
of the honourable Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-Il,

Perumbavoor and call for the records which leads to Annexure
AL

3. On the basis of the allegations in the petition, this court
has called for a report from the Judicial First Class Magistrate's
Court-Il, Perumbavoor on this aspect, The learned Magistrate has
sent a report, which reads as follows:

“May [ humbly submit the following for kind consideration and

favourable orders,

‘The complaint was originally filed before the Judicial First
 201SKER7I6
CALM.C.2097/2015 3

Class Magistrate's Court-1, Perumbavoor as C.C.No.223/2010 on
263.2010. Subsequently the case was transferred to this court by
Hon'ble CJM and renumbered as C.C.113/2012 on 13.3.2012. The
case was disposed on 28.11.2012 by this court. Accused was found
guilty under section 138 of NI Act, convicted and sentenced to
undergo simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a
compensation of Rs.4,00,000/- (four lakhs only) with interest @9%
per annum, that would come to Rs.1,05,000/- to the complainant
w/s.357/- Cr.PC. In default of payment of compensation accused was
further sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one month.
Since, the accused was absent on 28.11.2012, he was directed to
appear before the Court on 28.12.2012 for receiving the sentence.

While so, accused filed Crl.A. 30/2013 before the Additional
District and Sessions Court, Muvattupuzha and the appeal was
disposed on 25.7.2014. Judgment in Crl.A.30/13 dated 25.7.2014
was received before this Court on 22.11.2014. Vide that order appeal
was allowed in part and accused was sentenced to undergo simple
imprisonment for a day till the rising of Court and to pay a
compensation of Rs.4,00,000/- ws. 357(3) CrPC. In default of
payment of compensation, simple imprisonment for 3 months.
Accused was directed to appear before this Court within 45 days from
the date of appellate judgment. But accused failed to appear before
this Court as directed by Hon'ble appellate court and hence, non
bailable warrant and distress warrant were issued against the accused.
Case stands posted to 19.5.2015."

 CALM.C.2097/2015 4

4. When the application came up this court for hearing today,
the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he has already
filed a copy application for getting certified copy of the order and
he wants to file a revision and since he was not aware of the
disposal of the appeal, he could not take further steps in this

regard. So he wants a breathing time of two weeks for filing a

revision and getting appropriate orders from the revisional court.

5. The application is opposed by the leamed Public
Prosecutor.

6. Considering nature of reliefs claimed by the petitioner,
this court felt that this application can be disposed of hearing the
leaned counsel for the petitioner and the teamed Public
Prosecutor and considering the report of the learned Magistrate.

7. On going through the report of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court -Il, Perumbavoor, it is seen that the Additional

Sessions Court, Muvattupuzha had disposed of the appeal
 CALM.C.2097/2015 5

confirming the order of conviction passed by the Judicial First
Class Magistrate's Court -II, Perumbavoor in C.C. No.113 of 2012,
but modified the sentence by allowing the appeal in part sentencing
the petitioner to undergo imprisonment till rising of the court and
to pay a compensation of Rs.4,00,000/- to the complainant in
default to undergo simple imprisonment for 3 months, under
Section 357(3) of the Code, as per order dated 25.7.2014 and 45
days time from the date of order of appellate court was granted to
comply with the directions. The order was received by the
Magistrate on 22.11.2014. Since the petitioner did not appear as
directed, a non bailable warrant as well as distress warrants have
been issued and now the case is posted to 19.5.2015. On going
through the report, itis seen that there is no illegality committed
by the court below as the petitioner did not appear as directed by
the appellate court to receive the sentence. But however,
considering the pitiable condition of the petitioner that he could

not file the revision, since he did not get the information regarding
 201SKER7I6

CALM.C.2097/2015 6

the disposal of the case from his counsel, this court feels that some
time can be granted to the petitioner to file the revision, So, two
weeks' time from today is granted to the petitioner to file revision

onal court. Till

and to get necessary interim orders from the re'
then the coercive steps initiated by the Judicial First Class
Magistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor is directed to be kept in
abeyance. If no interim order has been produced by the petitioner
within that time, the court below is at liberty to proceed with the
coercive steps already initiated against the petitioner.

With the above observations and directions, this Crl.M.C. is
disposed of. The office is directed to communicate this order to

the concerned court immediately.
