‘THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure ("the Code” for brevity).

2. The 2” respondent is the de facto complainant in C.C.
No.1297 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Chavakkad. The 1* petitioner is the husband and
petitioners 2 and 3 are his parents. They are being proceeded
against for having committed offence punishable under Section

406, 420 and 498A r/w. Section 34 of the IPC.

3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the
proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The party
respondents have filed separate affidavits stating that they have
no subsisting grievance and they have no objection in terminating

the criminal proceedings.

4, The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted
that the statement of the party respondents have been recorded
and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it

involves no public interest.
 5. Ihave considered the submissions advanced.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 Scc
303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC

466], the Apex Court has

down that in appropriate cases, the
High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes
between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the
criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra _Raghuvanshi_&
Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58],

is the duty of the courts to encourage

it was observed that i
genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder
over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts
should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the
Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing,
but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also
require that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all
the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this
Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers

under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A2
 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the
petitioners now pending as C.C.No.1297 of 2012 on the file of the

Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad are quashed.
