ORDER

Dated this the 8% day of January 2021

Petitioners are accused numbers 1 to 5 in a
private complaint filed by the 2” respondent
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate court,
Idukki. Annexure III is the private complaint
filed by the 2™ respondent. Annexure IV is the

order taking cognizance of the offenc

The case of the 2™ respondent is that due

to some previous enmity, on 14.02.2013, the 1*
accused along with other accused wrongfuly
restrained the defacto complainant while he was
travelling in a Tipper Lorry and assaulted the
husband of the complainant. In connection with
the above incident Crime No.115/2013 was
registered by Idukki Police alleging offences
punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 430
506(i) read with Section 34 of the IPC. The
offence under Section 3 (1)(X) of the SC/ST

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act was also alleged.

After conducting a full fledged investigation, the

Police referred the cai

as per Annexure I refer
report. Thereafter, Annexure III complaint was
filed and the learned Magistrate taken on file the

same as C.P.No.12/2015 for the offences interalia

under Section 3(1)(X) of the SC/ST (PA) Act.

proc

dings in C.P.No.12/2015 on the file of the
Judicial First Class Magistrate court, Idukki.

Heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the 2™ respondent. Heard the
learned Public Prosecutor also.

The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the continuatin of Annexure III
based on Annexure IV proceedings is an abuse of

counsel, the husband of the 2" respondent was an
accused in Crime No.95/2013 of Idukki Police

Station. That is the main case and the present

case is the counter case to that case. The

husband of the 2 respondent faced trial before

the Second Additional Sessions Judge in
8.C.No.322/2013. He was convicted by the trial
court as per judgment dated 29.10.2014 in
$.C.No.322/2013. Annexur II is the judgment. The

learned counsel submitted that after the

acquittal, the present counter case is filed by
the 2° respondent on 12.05.2015. According to
the counsel, the place of occurrence and time are
same in Crime No.95/2013 and in Annexure III
private complaint. Therefore, it is a case and
counter case. The learned counsel submitted that
Annexure III private complaint is time barred. It
is also contended that the principles laid down by
the Apex Court in Sudir.v. State of M.P.2001(1)KLT
682 is flouted in this case. More over, the
learned counsel also submitted that while taking
cognizance of the offence by the learned
Magistrate as per Annexure IV order, Annexure I
refer report is not considered. The learned
counsel relied the judgments of this Court in

The learned counsel also submitted that the
learned Magistrate taken on file the case as per
Annexure IV order under Section 3(1) (Xx) SC/ST(PA)
Act also. The learned counsel submitted that this
is an offence exclusively triable by the Special
Court, Therefore, according to the counsel, the
learned Magistrate ought to have examined all the
witnesses cited in the complaint as per proviso to
Section 202 Cr.P.C. The learned counsel submitted

that Annexure III and IV proceedings are abuse of

process of court and the continuation of the same
is unnecessary in the facts and circumstances of

6. The learned counsel for the 2™ respondent
submitted that this is not a case in which this
Court has to invoke the powers under Section 482
Ce.P.c. According to the learned counsel, the
protest complaint was filed immediately after the
refer report was filed before the court. The

learned counsel submitted that there is absolutely

no delay in filing the protest complaint. The
learned counsel submitted that he may be given an
opportunity to adduce evidence before the lower

court.

that the Police after investigation submitted a

xefer report.

It is an admitted fact that the Crime
Number 95/2013 and Crime Number 115/2013 of Idukki
Police Station are case and counter case. The
husband of the 2™ respondent is the accused in
Crime No.95/2013. The witnesses in Crime
No.95/2013 are the close relatives of the
petitioners. It is a settled position that the
case and the counter case should be tried
simultaneously one after another. This point is
considered by the Apex Court in Sudir.v. State of

M.P.2001(1)KLT 682. The relevant paragraph in the

above case is extracted here unde:

criminal cases are compendiously called "case and
counter case" by some High Courts and “cross cases”
by some other High Courts. Way back in nineteen
hundred and twenties a Division Bench of the Madr.
High Court (Waller, and Cornish, JJ) made a
‘suggestion (In Re Goriparthi Krishtanma - 1929 Madras
Weekly Notes 881) that "a case and counter case
arising out of the same affair should always, 1f
practicable, be tried by the same court; and ‘each
party would represent themselves as having been the
innocent victims of the aggression of the other.”

10, Close to its heels vackson, J, made an
exhortation to the then legislature to provide a
mechanism as a statutory provision for trial of both
cases by the same court (vide Krishna Pannadi vs.
Emperor AIR 1930 Mad.190), The learned judge said
hus:

"there is no clear law as regards the procedure in
counter cases, a defect which the Legislature ought
to remedy. Tf is a generally recognized rule that
‘such cases should be tried in quick succession by the
same Judge, who should not pronounce judgment till
the hearing of both cases is finished.”

11. We are unable to understand why the Legislature
is still parrying to incorporate such a salubrious
practice as a statutory requirement in the Code. The
Practical reasons for adopting a procedure that such
cross cases shall be tried by the same court, can be
summarised thus: (1) It staves off the danger of an
accused being convicted before his whole case is
before the court. (2) It deters conflicting judgments
being delivered upon similar facts: and (3) In
reality the case and the counter case are, to all
intents and purposes, different or conflicting
versions of one incident.

12, In fact, many High Courts have reiterated the
need to follow the said practice as a necessary legal
requirement for preventing conflicting decisions
regarding one incident. This court has given ite
approval to the said practice in Nathi Lal & ors. vs.
State of U.P. & anr. [1990 (Supp) SCC 145). The
procedure to be followed in such a situation has been
‘succinctly delineated in the said decision and it can
be extracted her

‘We think that the fair procedure to adopt in a
matter like the present where there are cross cases,
4s ¢o direct that the same learned Judge must cry
both cross cases one after the other. After the
recording of evidence in one case is completed, he

 Crl.MC.No. 5259 OF 2015 202U/KERIRA

must hear the arguments but he must reserve the
Judgment. Thereafter he must proceed to hear the
Gross case and after recording all the evidence he
must hear the arguments but reserve the judgment in
that case. The same learned Judge must thereafter
dispose of the matters by two separate judgments. In
deciding each of the cases, he can rely only on the
evidence recorded in that particular case. The
‘evidence recorded in the cross cannot be looked into.
Nor can the judge be influenced by whatever is argued
in the cross case. Each case must be decided on the
basis of the evidence which has been placed on record
in that particular case without being influenced in
any manner by the evidence or argunents urged in the
‘cross case. But both the judgments must be pronounced
by the same learned Judge one after the other.”

13. How to implenent the said schene in a situation
where one of the two cases (relating to the same
incident) is charge-sheeted or complained of,
Anvolves offences or offence exclusively triable by &
Court of Sessions, but none of the offences involved
in the other case is exclusively triable by the
Sessions Court. The magistrate before whom the former
case reaches has no escape from committing the case
to the Sessions Court as provided in Section 209 of
the Code. Once the said case is comitted to the
Sessions Court, thereafter it is governed by the
provisions submitted in Chapter XVIII of the Code.
Though, the next case cannot be committed in
accordance with Section 209 of the Code, the
magistrate has, nevertheless, power to commit the
case to the court of Sessions, albeit none of the
offences involved therein is exclusively triable by
the Sessions Court. Section 323 is incorporated in
the Code to meet similar cases also. That section
reads thus:

"If, in any inquiry into an offence or a trial
before a magistrate, it appears to him at any stage
of the proceedings before signing judgment that the
case is one which ought to be tried by the Court of
Session, he shall commit it to that Court under the
provisions hereinbefore contained and thereupon the
provisions of chapter XVIII shall apply to the
conitment so made.”

14. The above section does not make an inroad into
Section 209 because the former ia intended to cover
‘cases to which Section 209 does not apply. when a
Magistrate has committed a case on account of his
legislative compulsion by Section 209, its cross
case, having no offence exclusively triable by the
Sessions Court, must appear to the magistrate as one

reasons as to why it should be so. Hence, the
magistrate can exercise the special power conferred
on him by virtue of Section 323 of the Code when he

ns. Commitment under Section 209 and 323 might
be through two different channels, but once they are
committed their subsequent flow could only be

Admittedly, the main case which is Crime
No.95/2013 concluded as per Annexure II judgment
in which the husband of the 2nd respondent is
already convicted and sentenced. Therefore, there
is no chance for a simulteneous trial of Annexure
III complaint and Crime No.95/2013. Hence the
continuation of Annexure III will definitely

prejudice the interest of the petitioners/accused.

11. A perusal of the above order will show
that there is nothing to show that the learned
Magistrate considered Annexure I refer report
while taking cognizance of the above offences
This Court in Kader v, State of Kerala 1999(3)KLT
55 observed like this

7. The Court noted that the scope of enquiry
under 5.202 is the ascertainment of the truth or
falsity of the allegations made in the complaint on
the materials placed by the complainant before the
Court for the limited purpose of finding out
whether the prima facie case for issue of process
has been made out and for deciding the question
purely from the point of view of the complainant
without at all adverting to any defence that the
accused may have. Nevertheless, the Court has a
duty 0 protect the interest of the absent accused
also because at the particular stage, the accused
has no say in the matter and the matter is decided
without notice to him. It is, therefore, open to
the Magistrate to scrutinise carefully the
allegations made in the complaint with a view to
prevent the accused therein from being called upon
to face obviously frivolous complaint and to find
what material there is to support the allegations
fade in the complaint. The Magistrate has a duty
not only to bring to book a person or persons
against whom grave allegations are made in the
complaint but also to protect the interest of the
‘absent accused in such matters. What all should
take cognizance of the offence, will depend upon
the facts and cizcumstances of each case. He has
necessarily to consider the allegations made in the
complaint and the statement of the complainant
recorded under $,200 Cr.P.C as also of the
witnesses examined under $.202 of the Cr.P.C.
Along with that, he has also to consider the resulé
of enquiry or investigation, if any, held by the
police. It cannot be said that the said data is
hot an essential factor. The consideration of the
materiale under $.202 of the Cr.P.c. is not an
enpty formality and cannot be done in a perfunctory
er mechanical manner or by adopting a superficial
approach.”

like this:

13. In the light of the above decisions,
according to me Annexure IV order is
unsustainable. As I said earlier there is nothing
to show in Annexure IV order to the effect that
the learned Magistrate considered Annexure I refer
report while passing that order. Therefore,

Annexure IV order is unsustainable.

14, Then the next question is what is the

purpose in remanding this matter to the lower

court. Admittely, the main case is already

disposed by the learned Sessions Judge as per
 ae

22UKERIDST

$259 OF 2015

13
Annexure II judgment. Therefore, there cannot be
@ simultaneous trial as held by the Apex Court in
Sudir's case (Supra). Hence, there is no purpose
in remanding this matter to the learned
Magistrate. Moreover, the petitioners will be
prejudiced if Annexure III is proceeded because

the main case already disposed as evident by

Annexure II judgment. | Moreover, proviso to
Section 202 Cr.P.C. says that if it appears to the
Magistrate that the offence committed is triable
exclusively by the court of Sessions, he shall

call up on the complainant to produce all his

es and examine them. Admittedly, there are
five witnesses mentioned in Annexure III
complaint. It is an admitted fact that only four

witn

were examined before the learned
Magistrate in Section 202 Cr.P.C. enquiry. On

that ground also the order is unsustainable.

15. The alleged incident in this case happened
on 14.02.2013. The Police after investigation

submitted Annexure I refer report on 14.05.2015.
 ae

22UKERIDST

Thereafter, the main case was disposed by the

learned Se:

ions Judge on 29.10.2014. Thereafter
Annexure III complaint was filed on 12.05.2015.
According to me the continuation of Annexures III

and IV proc

dings is an abu:

of process of court
in the light of the facts and circumstances of
this case and also for the reasons mentioned

above

Therefore, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all
further proceedings in C.P.No.12/2015 on the file
of the Judicial First Class Magistrate court,

Idukki are quashed.
