Cri. M.C No.2613 of 2015

Dated this the 5" day of May, 2015.
ORDER

The petitioners seek orders quashing the prosecution in
C.C No. 687 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate
Court, Muvattupuzha, involving the offence under Sections
448 and 506(1) IPC. The offences are well compoundable
under Section 320 Cr.P.C. It is not known why the petitioners
approached this vacation court when the regular court will
have sitting on all days in a week. The petitioners and the
victim can very well approach the learned Magistrate for
composition under Section 320 Cr.P.C.

With these observations this Crl.M.C is closed.

P.UBAID,
JUDGE
