ORDER

The accused No.6 who was enlarged on bail by
imposing conditions including surrender of the
passport came up before this court, aggrieved by an
order by the learned Magistrate refusing to release
the passport, so as to enable him to leave the state.
It will not come under the purview of Section 482
cr.P.C.. The remedy lies somewhere else. Instead of
exhausting the remedy available to the party, the
petitioner came up with an application under Section
482 Cr.P.C. Without prejudice to the right of
parties to exhaust the proper remedy as per the lux
fori and lux loci, the Cr1.M.C. is dismissed. Return
the certified copy of Annexure A3 to the concerned

counsel on proper application forthwith.
