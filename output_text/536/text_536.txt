COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:

P. Wo.752 0:

COMMON ORDER

Dated this the 7th day of January 2020
Petitioner is the 1* accused in CC No.1211/2018 on the
files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,

Thiruvananthapuram for having allegedly committed offences

punishable under Se

1S 120B, 116, 468 and 511 of 420 IPC
t/w Section 34 of IPC.

2. The allegation in brief against the petitioner and other
accused is that they had hatched a conspiracy to manipulate the
lottery drawing machines of the lottery department of
Government of Kerala and that the 2” accused at the instigation
of the 1% accused, who is the petitioner herein offered money to
the de facto complainant for setting the last three digits of
lottery drawing machine in a particular manner, which was
already set and thereby attempted manipulating the machine.

3. The petitioner had approached the trial court with CMP
No.670/2019 seeking a discharge. The learned Magistrate vide
impugned order dated 25.04.2019 at Annexure AS in Cri.M.C.

No.6176/2019 found that the prayer was allowed in part and the
 220KERIAIS

P. 80.752 01

petitioner was exonerated the offences punishable under
Sections 120B and 116 of IPC, whereas charge was directed to
be framed under Sections 511 of 420 and S11 of 468 r/w

Section 34 of IPC. Aggrieved by the said order of not

discharging him completely, the petitioner filed Cri.
No.752/2019 and also filed Crl.M.C No.6176/2019 for quashing
the proceedings under Section 482 of CrPC. Both these
petitions were considered together.

4, Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as also the
learned Senior Public Prosecutor in detail and perused the
records, I find that the court below was justified in passing the
order retaining the case against the petitioner for offences
punishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 r/w
Section 34 IPC. At the stage of framing of charge and
quashing of proceedings, it is not the appropriate time to either
go through the documents or the statements of the witnesses in
detail. The specific case against the petitioner is that he had
instigated the 2" accused to manipulate the machine. Whether
he actually instigated the 2” accused or not is something which
is to be proved by the prosecution during the course of

evidence. Going by the allegations alone, the offences are
 220KERIAIS

P. 80.752 01

attracted. It is not possible for this Court either at the time of
framing of charge, or at the time of quashing the proceedings as
required under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., to consider these minute
details in the evidence that may be adduced. The statement of
the witnesses cannot be gone into detail to conclude regarding
the complicity of petitioner.

5. Under the circumstances, I am not convinced by the
arguments placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner
either to quash the proceedings or to interfere with the
impugned order of the Magistrate not discharging the petitioner
for offences punishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of
468 r/w Section 34 IPC.

In the result, Crl.R.P, No.752/2019 as well as Cri.M.C
No.6176/2019 are not sustainable. While dismissing both these
petitions, the learned Magistrate is directed to expedite the trial
of CC No.1211/2018 for the reason that the petitioner is anxious
to prove himself innocent in the matter and actually claims

himself to be a whistle blower, than an accused.
