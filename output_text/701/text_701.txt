 2019KERI6S7

ORDER

This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure (“the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash

the proceedings pending against the petitioner.

2. The 2" respondent is the wife of the petitioner. Their
marriage was solemnized on 09.11.2014 and they were living
together. In the course of their connubial relationship, serious
disputes cropped up. The 2 respondent specifically alleges that
the petitioner is guilty of culpable matrimonial cruelty. This finally
led to the institution of criminal proceedings at the instance of the

2" respondent. FIR was registered and after investig:

, final
report was laid before the learned Magistrate and the case is now
pending as C.C.No.1830 of 2017 on the files of the Judicial
Magistrate of First Class-I, Tirur. In the aforesaid case, the
petitioner is accused of having committed offences punishable

under Sections 498A and 406 read with Section 34 of the IPC.

3. The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner
 cel

2019KERI6S7

submitted that at the instance of well wishers and family
members, the parties have decided to put an end to their discord
‘and have decided to part ways. It is urged that the dispute is
purely private in nature. The learned counsel appearing for the 2
respondent invited the attention of this Court to the affidavit filed
by her and asserts that the disputes inter se have been settled
and the continuance of criminal proceedings will only result in
gross inconvenience and hardship. It is submitted that the 2”

respondent has no objection in allowing the prayer sought for.

4. The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions
has submitted that the statement of the 2” respondent has been
recorded and she has stated in unequivocal terms that the

settlement arrived at is genuine.

5. I have considered the submissions advanced.

6. In Gian_singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 scc
303] and in Narinder singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC
466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the
 cel

2019KERI6S7

High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes
between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the
criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra _Raghuvanshi_&
Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another (2013) 4 SCC 58, it
was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage
genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder
over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts
should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of
the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be
nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice

also require that the proceedings be quashed.

7. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am
of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in
invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code

to quash the proceedings.

In the result, this petition will stand allowed.

Annexure-A2 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto
 ce 2019KERI6S7

against the petitioner now pending as C.C.No.1830 of 2017 on the

file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Tirur are

quashed.
