JUDGMENT
 ‘This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura
Police Station in crime No. 179/2010 against the accused, 2 in numbers,
alleging commission of offences ws. 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i) rw 34 of IPC.
‘The prosecution case in brief is that, in furtherance of their common intention,
‘on 12/03/2010 at 7. 30 pm, at house No. T.C 19/1726, KRRA 64 at
Mudavanmugal Ward in Thirumala Village, the 1* accused caught hold on the
neck of CW2, abused him and kicked on his abdomen and pushed him down.
‘When CW1 intervened, the 1* and 2" accused threw bricks at CWI thereby
‘causing injury on the right side of her forehead. The accused also threw piece
Of brick at CW3 thereby causing injury to her and also criminally intimidated
‘WL by threatening to kill her. The accused thereby committed the offences
as alleged against them,

Originally the case was taken on file as CC: 328/2010, Since the accused were
absconding, the case was entered in LPR as LP: 55/2017. Thereafter, the
accused were arrested and produced before the court on 01/01/2018 and the
‘case was taken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 1/2018.

Accused Nos. 1 and 2 were enlarged on bail and they were furnished with
copies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the
offences ws 324, 323, 294(b), 506()) rv 34 of IPC__was framed and it was
read over and explained to them and they pleaded not guilty.

‘To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1, CW3 and CW2 as PWI
to PWS respectively and marked a document as Ext.PI. Since the witnesses
‘examined did not support the prosecution, CW4 to CW? were given up by the

leamed APP. Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed, As there were no
 3

incriminating circumstances brought out in evidence against accused,
‘examination ws 313 of Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce
any evidence,

6. Heard both the sides.

7. The points that arise for consideration are:~

1, Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable ws 324,
323, 294(b), 506(i) t/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?
2. What shall be the sentence or order?

8. PointNo.L :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 3 witnesses
and 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 deposed that accused
are her brother and his wife. She deposed that on 12/03/2010 somebody
attacked her after switching off the light. She affirmed lodging Ex.P1 FI
Statement given to police. She further deposed that the matter was settled and
she has no grievances against the accused. PW2 is the sister of PW1. She
deposed affirming the incident, but stated that she had not seen who had
attacked them, PW3, the other injured also deposed in similar lines and stated
that he did not know the assailants. Thus, all the material witnesses turned
hostile to prosecution. Therefore, the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave
up the remaining witnesses, From the above evidence, there is nothing to
prove the occurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences.
‘Thus, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused committed the offences
‘ws 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i) sw 34 of IPC Point No.1 is found against the
prosecution,

9. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2
 4
are found not guilty of the offences punishable ws 324, 323, 294(b), S06())
tw 34 of IPC, they are acquitted ws 248(1) of CrPC and set at libery,
‘cancelling their bail bonds.

Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected

nd pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28* day of February 2025.
