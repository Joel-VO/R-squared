ORDER

This petition was filed under section 14 of the Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest
Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”) for taking possession of the
secured asset which is the scheduled property.

2. The petitioner is a company registered under the Companies
‘Act, 1956. It is represented by its authorized officer. The petitioner is the

secured creditor and the respondents are the secured debtors. The
 respondents created a security interest by virtue of a security agreement in
respect of the scheduled property ie., the secured asset in favour of the
petitioner in respect of the financial assistance that they availed from the
petitioner. The respondents committed default in repaying the loan.
Therefore the account was classified as Non Performing Asset on
08/08/2024. On 14/08/2024 the petitioner issued a demand notice
Ws.13(2) of the Act to the respondents calling upon them to repay the loan
amount in full within 60 days. The notice was served on the 1" and 3"
respondents and notice to 2 respondent was not served. So the petitioner
published a copy of the notice in two newspapers. Even after the issuance of
demand notice u/s.13(2) of the Act, the respondents did not repay the loan
amount within the statutory period. So, the petitioner filed this petition for
taking possession of the secured asset for realization of the amount due to
the petitioner's bank.

3. The authorized Officer of the petitioner filed affidavit in
compliance of Sec.14 of the Act. The affidavit and the documents
produced by the petitioner show that the respondents created a security
interest in respect of the secured asset in favour of the petitioner at the
time of availing loan and they failed to repay the amount even after the
receipt of the statutory notice u/s.13(2) of the Act. Hence I find that the
petitioner is entitled for possession of the secured asset which is the
scheduled property through the proceedings of this cour.

In the result, the petition is allowed as follow:

1, Advocate Sarath.U _(K/3352/23) is appointed asthe
commissioner to take possession of the scheduled property with due notice to

the respondents and hand it over to the petitioner on proper acknowledgment.
‘The petitioner shall pay a batta of Rs.5500/- to the commissioner within 15
days from today and and pay Rs.1500/- on filing report by the commissioner.
 3

2. The petitioner shall provide a copy of the petition including the
schedule of secured asset to the advocate comt

jioner for executing the
order.

3. ‘The Station House Officer of the Police Station in the area in
which the secured assets situated, shall give necessary assistance to the
commissioner if so required for executing the order.

4, The Advocate commissioner is permitted to break open the
premises if required so.

5. The commissioner is directed to prepare an inventory in
triplicate to be attested by two respectable witnesses as regards the
execution of this order and in taking possession of the scheduled property
and copies thereof shall be given to the petitioner as well as the
respondents on proper acknowledgment. The remaining one copy shall be
filed along with the commissioner's report before the court.

6. The commissioner shall execute the order within 60 days from
the date of payment of first part of the batta as directed in clause (i).
