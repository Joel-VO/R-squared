Crl.M.C.No.2670 of 2015

Dated this the 5" day of May, 2015
ORDER
The petitioners herein are the original accused
Nos.3,5,8,10 and 13. in C.C, No.951/2011 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg. The offences involved in
this case are under Sections 143,147,148,452,323 and 427

read with149 IPC. The original accused Nos.1,

6,7,9,11,12
and 14 faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and obtained
a judgment of acquittal on 02.03.2015 under Section 248(1)
Cr.P.C., when all the material witnesses turned hostile to the
prosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the
parties out of court. The prosecution examined twelve
witnesses in the said case and marked Ext.P1. None of the
material witnesses examined in the case supported the
prosecution. In the absence of any evidence or incriminating
circumstance, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused
Nos.1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and 14, The case against the petitioners
herein was split up and refiled as C.C.280/2015. The petitioners
now seek orders quashing the prosecution as against them on

the ground that the very substratum of the prosecution case is
 201SKERI7602

CAM.C. No.2670 of 2015 2
totally lost by the acquittal of the others, and continuance of
prosecution against them will not serve any purpose. Annexure
= A3 judgment in C.C.951/2011 shows that all the material
witnesses examined by the prosecution in the said case turned

hos!

in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties
‘out of court. In such a situation, it is quite definite that the
prosecution cannot in any manner improve the case and the
witnesses also cannot in any manner help the prosecution, if
the case against the petitioners goes to trial. In short, such
proceeding will be a sheer waste of time.

In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution
against the petitioners in C.C.280/2015 of the Judicial First
Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg will stand quashed under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly,

the petitioners will stand released from prosecution.
