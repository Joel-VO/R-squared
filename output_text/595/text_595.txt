ORDER

A temporary gate installed obstructing the way
claimed by the accused was removed by him without
causing any destruction to the property. It is
alleged that it was removed violating the interim
order of injunction granted by a civil court. A
removal of obstructing structure over a way claimed
by the accused may not always constitute a criminal
offence, unless the same is coupled with any kind of
destruction. Violation of the interim order of
injunction, if any should be addressed under Order 39
Rule 2 A C.P.C. Hence the crime registered on the
allegation of Section 447 and 427 IPC based on a
civil dispute cannot be sustained. Hence the same

is quashed, Crl.M.C. is allowed accordingly.
