THIS CRININAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
 2024KERASAS

ORDER
Dated this the 12" day of January , 2024
This Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is at the

instance of the respondent in M.C.No.149 of 2022 on the
file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad,
impugning the order dated 02.09.2023 in Cri.M.P.No.3728

of 2023.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that
his wife and children filed M.C.No.149 of 2022 against him,
under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,
2005, (hereinafter referred as the D.V.Act) and obtained
Annexure A3 order, in which he was restrained from
committing domestic violence against them, and from
dispossessing them from the scheduled property.
Subsequently, his wife and children filed Annexure A4
violation petition against him, alleging that on 18.05.2023,
he abused and threatened them in violation of Annexure

3 protection order. Learned Magistrate as per Annexure
 2024KERASAS
AS order, took cognizance under Section 31 of the D.V. Act,

and S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file against him,

and he is challenging that order.

3. On going through Annexure AS order dated
02.09.2023, it could be seen that, after hearing the
petitioners in Cri.M.P.No.3728 of 2023, and on perusing the
report of the Protection Officer, learned Magistrate was
satisfied that sufficient grounds were there to proceed
against the respondent/husband under Section 31 of the
D.V. Act, and so, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file

against him.

4. The petitioner herein, is having every right and
opportunity to defend his case in S.T.No.2670 of 2023 by
adducing evidence. Without taking such a course, his
prayer is to quash Annexure AS order, even before the
parties could venture into prove or disprove their
allegations and counter allegations. On receipt of

Annexure A4 violation petition, the petitioners therein were
 2024KERASAS

heard, and the report of the Protection Officer was verified,
and on prima facie satisfaction of violation of the protection
order, learned Magistrate took cognizance under Section 31
of the D.V. Act and, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file
against him. This Court finds no illegality or impropriety in
the impugned order and hence the Crl.M.C. is liable to be

dismissed.

In the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed and the learned
Magistrate is directed to dispose S.T.No.2670 of 2023 as
early as possible, at any rate, within a period of two
months from today, on affording opportunity to both

parties to adduce their evidence, if any.
