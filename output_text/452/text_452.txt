1.As per order dated 6.8.2015 in Crl.R.P.No.711 of 2003,
this Court after maintaining the conviction imposed

rising of the Court and to pay a compensation of
Rs.5,000/-. Two months time was granted to deposit the

2.It is subi

ed by the learned counsel appearing for the

and to pay the compensation amount. The learned
counsel also relies on the judgment of this Court in
K.G.Girish Kumar v. Muthoot Capital Services Pvt.
Ltd.(2007 (4) KLT 16) and Subash Sait v. Sree
Gokulam Chits and Finances, Palakkad & Another
(2015(4) KLT 497) to contend that this Court in
appropriate cases have exercised powers under section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had granted the
relief. I am convinced of the reasons stated and I am of
the view that the time granted as per order dated
6.8.2015 can be extended by a period of two weeks to
secure the ends of justice.

3.Accordingly, the time granted as per order dated 6.8.2015
in Crl.R.P.No.711 of 2003 is extended by a period of two
weeks from today.

Petition is disposed of.
